#### Discussion

This property contains a quantity using length units, or `nil`.

> **Note**:  Provide a total distance value whenever the distance traveled is relevant to the workout type. In addition, add distance samples to a workout using the [`add(_:to:completion:)`](hkhealthstore/add(_:to:completion:).md) method. These samples should sum up to the total distance, while providing detailed information about how the intensity changes over the duration of the workout.
