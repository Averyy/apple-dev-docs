## Declaration

```swift
func supportsHealthRecords() -> Bool
```

#### Discussion

This method returns [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) if the device is set to a locale where clinical records are supported, or if the user already has clinical records downloaded to their HealthKit store. Otherwise, it returns [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false).

This method lets users switch their locale without losing their health records.
