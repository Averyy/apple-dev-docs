# appleMoveTime

**Framework**: HealthKit  
**Kind**: property

A quantity sample type that measures the amount of time the user has spent performing activities that involve full-body movements during the specified day.

**Availability**:
- iOS 14.5+
- iPadOS 14.5+
- Mac Catalyst 14.5+
- macOS 13.0+
- visionOS 1.0+
- watchOS 7.4+

## Declaration

```swift
static let appleMoveTime: HKQuantityTypeIdentifier
```

#### Discussion

[`appleMoveTime`](hkquantitytypeidentifier/applemovetime.md) measures every full minute where the watch detects the user actively moving. Apple Watch uses the accelerometer and gyroscopes to detect activities that involve full-body movements, like walking, running, or playing in the playground.

For younger users, HealthKit’s activity summary can track move time instead of active energy burned:

- HealthKit automatically tracks move time for any users under 13 years old.
- Users 13 to 18 years old can choose whether to track move time or active calorie burn.
- All users over 18 years old track active calorie burn.

These samples use time units (described in [`HKUnit`](hkunit.md)) and measure cumulative values (described in [`HKQuantityAggregationStyle`](hkquantityaggregationstyle.md)).
