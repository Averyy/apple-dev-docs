# physicalEffort

**Framework**: HealthKit  
**Kind**: property

A quantity sample type that measures the estimated amount of energy being used to perform a task excluding other factors such as temperature, altitude, or heart rate.

**Availability**:
- iOS 17.0+
- iPadOS 17.0+
- Mac Catalyst 17.0+
- macOS 14.0+
- visionOS 1.0+
- watchOS 10.0+

## Declaration

```swift
static let physicalEffort: HKQuantityTypeIdentifier
```

#### Discussion

These samples use power in Metabolic Equivalent of Task (METs) units (described in [`HKUnit`](hkunit.md)) and measure discrete values (described in [`HKQuantityAggregationStyle`](hkquantityaggregationstyle.md)). Physical effort is estimated and recorded automatically by Apple Watch.
