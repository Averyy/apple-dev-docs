## Declaration

```swift
static let distanceCrossCountrySkiing: HKQuantityTypeIdentifier
```

#### Discussion

These samples use length units (described in [`HKUnit`](hkunit.md)) and measure cumulative values (described in [`HKQuantityAggregationStyle`](hkquantityaggregationstyle.md)). During outdoor cross country skiing workouts, the system automatically collects distance samples on Apple Watch.
