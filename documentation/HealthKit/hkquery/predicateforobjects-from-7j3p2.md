## Declaration

```swift
class func predicateForObjects(from source: HKSource) -> NSPredicate
```

#### Return Value

A predicate that matches all the objects created by the provided source.

#### Discussion

Use this convenience method to create a predicate that finds all the objects from a specific app or device. The following sample uses both the convenience method and a predicate format string to create equivalent predicates.

## Parameters

- `source`: The source that saved data into the HealthKit store. The source object represents either an app or a devices capable of saving data directly into the HealthKit store (for example, a linked Bluetooth heart rate monitor).

  Returns a predicate that matches objects based on the provided metadata key, value, and operator.
- [class func predicateForObjectsWithNoCorrelation() -> NSPredicate](hkquery/predicateforobjectswithnocorrelation.md)
