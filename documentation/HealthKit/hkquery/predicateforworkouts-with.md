## Declaration

```swift
class func predicateForWorkouts(with workoutActivityType: HKWorkoutActivityType) -> NSPredicate
```

#### Return Value

A predicate for matching workouts based on the type of activity.

#### Discussion

Use this convenience method to create a predicate that matches workouts based on their activity. The following sample uses both the convenience method and a predicate format string to create equivalent predicates.

## Parameters

- `workoutActivityType`: The type of activity. For a list of valid workout activities, see  .
