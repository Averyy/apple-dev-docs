#### Return Value

A predicate that matches any objects that have been added to the provided workout.

#### Discussion

Use this convenience method to create a predicate that matches all the HealthKit objects for a given workout. The following sample uses both the convenience method and a predicate format string to create equivalent predicates.

## Parameters

- `workout`: The workout you are searching for.
