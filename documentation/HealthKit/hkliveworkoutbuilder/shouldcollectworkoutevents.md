- watchOS 5.0+

## Declaration

var shouldCollectWorkoutEvents: Bool { get set }
```

## Mentions

- [Running workout sessions](running-workout-sessions.md)

#### Discussion

By default, this property is [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true). Set it to [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) if your app adds its own events to the workout builder, and you want to ignore events from the workout session.

You must set this property before calling the workout builder’s [`beginCollection(withStart:completion:)`](hkworkoutbuilder/begincollection(withstart:completion:).md) method.
