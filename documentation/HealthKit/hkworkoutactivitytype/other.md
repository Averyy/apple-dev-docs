#### Discussion

If your app uses the [`HKWorkoutActivityType.swimming`](hkworkoutactivitytype/swimming.md) or [`HKWorkoutActivityType.other`](hkworkoutactivitytype/other.md) activity type, you must explain how your app calculates workout data when sensor information is not available. For more information, see the [`Human Interface Guidelines`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/watchos/interaction/workout/).
