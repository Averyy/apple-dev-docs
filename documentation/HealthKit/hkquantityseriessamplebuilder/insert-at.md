## Declaration

```swift
func insert(_ quantity: HKQuantity, at date: Date) throws
```

#### Discussion

This method calls [`insert(_:for:)`](hkquantityseriessamplebuilder/insert(_:for:).md), passing a date interval with the provided start date, and a duration of `0`.

## Parameters

- `quantity`: The quantity to insert.
- `date`: The start date associated with the quantity. If this is the same start date as a previously provided quantity, this quantity replaces the previous one. This method fails with an   error if the   parameter is earlier than the series builder’s   property.
