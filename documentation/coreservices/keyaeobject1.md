#### Discussion

Identifies a descriptor for the element that is currently being compared to the object or data specified by the descriptor for the keyword `keyAEObject2`. Either object can be described by a descriptor of type `typeObjectSpecifier` or `typeObjectBeingExamined`.

A descriptor of `typeObjectBeingExamined` acts as a placeholder for each of the successive elements in a container when the Apple Event Manager tests those elements one at a time.
