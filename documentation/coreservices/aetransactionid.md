#### Discussion

A transaction is a sequence of Apple events that are sent back and forth between the client and server applications, beginning with the client’s initial request for a service. When you call the [`AECreateAppleEvent(_:_:_:_:_:_:)`](1448525-aecreateappleevent.md) function, you pass a value of type `AETransactionID` for the `transactionID` parameter. [`ID Constants for the AECreateAppleEvent Function`](apple_events/1542799-id_constants_for_the_aecreateapp.md) lists the valid constant values for a variable or parameter of this type.
