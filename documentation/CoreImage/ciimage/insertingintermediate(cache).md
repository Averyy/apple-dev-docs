# insertingIntermediate(cache:)

**Framework**: Core Image  
**Kind**: method  
**Role**: Instance Method

Create an image that inserts a intermediate that is cacheable.

**Availability**:
- iOS 12.0+
- iPadOS 12.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- macOS 10.14+
- tvOS 12.0+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
func insertingIntermediate(cache: Bool) -> CIImage
```

```objc
- (CIImage *) imageByInsertingIntermediate:(BOOL) cache;
```

## Return Value

An autoreleased [`CIImage`](../ciimage.md).

## Parameters

- `cache`: Controls if Core Image caches the returned image. If `true`, this intermediate will be cacheable even if [`cacheIntermediates`](../cicontextoption/cacheintermediates.md) is false. If `false`, the intermediate will be not be cached if [`cacheIntermediates`](../cicontextoption/cacheintermediates.md) is false.
