```

```objc
+ (CIFilter<CICompositeOperation> *) lightenBlendModeFilter;
```

#### Return Value

The modified image.

#### Discussion

This method applies the lighten-blend mode filter to an image. The effect replaces any samples in the background image that are darker than input image.

The lighten-blend mode filter uses the following properties:

- **`inputImage`**: An image with the type [`CIImage`](../ciimage.md).
- **`backgroundImage`**: An image with the type [`CIImage`](../ciimage.md).

The following code creates a filter that results in the image that blends the input and background image colors:

```swift
func lightenBlendMode(inputImage: CIImage, backgroundImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let colorBlendFilter = CIFilter.lightenBlendMode()
    colorBlendFilter.inputImage = inputImage
    colorBlendFilter.backgroundImage = backgroundImage
    return colorBlendFilter.outputImage!
}
```

![The image on the top left shows a beach with multiple palm trees and a rainbow arching across the blue sky.  The image below is a gradient image displaying a gradual color shift from purple to a dark orange. The image on the right shows the output from applying a lighten blend mode filter. The result displays colors from both images with the brightness of the beach image.](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/images/com.apple.coreimage/media-3546398@2x.png)
