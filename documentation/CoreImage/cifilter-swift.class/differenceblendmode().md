```

```objc
+ (CIFilter<CICompositeOperation> *) differenceBlendModeFilter;
```

## Return Value

The modified image.

## Discussion

This method applies the difference-blend mode filter to an image. The effect calculates the brightness value for both images and subtracts the smaller value, resulting in a slightly darker image. This effect doesn’t modify images that are black.

The difference-blend mode filter uses the following properties:

- **`inputImage`**: An image with the type [`CIImage`](../ciimage.md).
- **`backgroundImage`**: An image with the type [`CIImage`](../ciimage.md).

The following code creates a filter that blends colors in the background image and input image:

```swift
func differenceBlendMode(inputImage: CIImage, backgroundImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let colorBlendFilter = CIFilter.differenceBlendMode()
    colorBlendFilter.inputImage = inputImage
    colorBlendFilter.backgroundImage = backgroundImage
    return colorBlendFilter.outputImage!
}
```

![The image on the top left shows a beach with multiple palm trees and a rainbow arching across the blue sky.  The image below is a gradient image displaying a gradual color shift from purple to a dark orange. The image on the right shows the output from applying a difference-blend mode filter. This displays colors from both images with the clarity and brightness from the beach rainbow image.](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/images/com.apple.coreimage/media-3546397@2x.png)
