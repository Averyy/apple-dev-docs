## Discussion

This method applies the color polynomial filter to an image. The effect calculates the sum of each pixel’s color component value and the coefficient properties together to produce the output image.

The color polynomial filter uses the following properties:

- **`redCoefficients`**: A vector representing the polynomial coefficients for the red channel as a [`CIVector`](../civector.md).
- **`greenCoefficients`**: A vector representing the polynomial coefficients for the green channel as a [`CIVector`](../civector.md).
- **`blueCoefficients`**: A vector representing the polynomial coefficients for the blue channel as a [`CIVector`](../civector.md).
- **`alphaCoefficients`**: A vector representing the polynomial coefficients for the alpha channel as a [`CIVector`](../civector.md).
- **`inputImage`**: An image with the type [`CIImage`](../ciimage.md).

The following code creates a filter that adds a lighter contrast to the input image:

```swift
func colorPolynomial(inputImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let colorPolynomialFilter = CIFilter.colorPolynomial()
    colorPolynomialFilter.alphaCoefficients = CIVector (x: 0, y: 0.6, z: 0, w: 0)
    colorPolynomialFilter.redCoefficients = CIVector (x: 0, y: 1, z: 0.1, w: 0)
    colorPolynomialFilter.greenCoefficients = CIVector(x: 0, y: 1, z: 0, w: 0)
    colorPolynomialFilter.blueCoefficients = CIVector(x: 0, y: 1, z: 0, w: 0)
    colorPolynomialFilter.inputImage = inputImage
    return colorPolynomialFilter.outputImage!
}
```
