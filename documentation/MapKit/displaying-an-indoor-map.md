# Displaying an Indoor Map

**Framework**: MapKit

Use the Indoor Mapping Data Format (IMDF) to show an indoor map with custom overlays and points of interest.

**Availability**:
- iOS 17.6+
- iPadOS 17.6+
- Xcode 16.0+

#### Overview

The sample app demonstrates decoding, rendering, and styling of a small subset of the IMDF feature types and their properties. Use these examples to create your own indoor map with a style that’s consistent with your app’s design. You’ll need to handle feature categories that are specific to your venue, and configure the map style using your own colors, icons, and level picker.
