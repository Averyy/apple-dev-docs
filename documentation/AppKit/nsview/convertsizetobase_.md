# convertSizeToBase:

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: method  
**Role**: Instance Method

Converts the size from the view’s coordinate system to the base coordinate system.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.5+ - Deprecated in 10.7

> **Deprecated**: Use [`convertToBacking(_:)`](./converttobacking%28_%29-4ra9y.md) instead.

## Declaration

```objc
- (NSSize) convertSizeToBase:(NSSize) size;
```

## Return Value

The size converted to the base coordinate system.

## Discussion

## Parameters

- `size`: A size in the view’s coordinate system

### Deprecated methods
- [func lockFocus()](./lockfocus%28%29.md)
  Locks the focus on the view, so subsequent commands take effect in the view’s window and coordinate system.
- [func lockFocusIfCanDraw() -> Bool](./lockfocusifcandraw%28%29.md)
  Locks the focus to the view atomically if the `canDraw` method returns `true` and returns the value of `canDraw`.
- [func lockFocusIfCanDraw(in: NSGraphicsContext) -> Bool](./lockfocusifcandraw%28in%29.md)
  Locks the focus to the view atomically if drawing can occur in the specified graphics context.
- [func unlockFocus()](./unlockfocus%28%29.md)
  Unlocks focus from the current view.
- [func scroll(NSRect, by: NSSize)](./scroll%28_,by%29.md)
  Copies the visible portion of the view’s rendered image within a region and lays that portion down again at a specified offset .
- [- convertPointToBase:](./convertpointtobase_.md)
  Converts the point from the view’s coordinate system to the base coordinate system.
- [- convertPointFromBase:](./convertpointfrombase_.md)
  Converts the point from the base coordinate system to the view’s coordinate system.
- [- convertSizeFromBase:](./convertsizefrombase_.md)
  Converts the size from the base coordinate system to the view’s coordinate system.
- [- convertRectToBase:](./convertrecttobase_.md)
  Converts the rectangle from the view’s coordinate system to the base coordinate system.
- [- convertRectFromBase:](./convertrectfrombase_.md)
  Converts the rectangle from the base coordinate system to the view’s coordinate system.
- [- performMnemonic:](./performmnemonic_.md)
  Implemented by subclasses to respond to mnemonics.
- [func shouldDrawColor() -> Bool](./shoulddrawcolor%28%29.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the view is being drawn to an environment that supports color.
- [func allocateGState()](./allocategstate%28%29.md)
  Causes the view to maintain a private graphics state object, which encapsulates all parameters of the graphics environment.
- [func gState() -> Int](./gstate%28%29.md)
  Returns the identifier for the view’s graphics state object, or 0 if the view doesn’t have a graphics state object.
- [func setUpGState()](./setupgstate%28%29.md)
  Overridden by subclasses to (re)initialize the view’s graphics state object.
