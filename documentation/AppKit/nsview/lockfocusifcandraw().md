# lockFocusIfCanDraw()

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: method  
**Role**: Instance Method

Locks the focus to the view atomically if the `canDraw` method returns `true` and returns the value of `canDraw`.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.0+ - Deprecated in 10.14

> **Deprecated**: Subclass the view and implement [`draw(_:)`](./draw%28_%29.md) instead.

## Declaration

```swift
func lockFocusIfCanDraw() -> Bool
```

```objc
- (BOOL) lockFocusIfCanDraw;
```

#### Discussion

Your thread will not be preempted by other threads between the `canDraw` method and the lock. This method fails to lock focus and returns [`false`](../../Swift/false.md), when the view is hidden and the current context is drawing to the screen (as opposed to a printing context).
