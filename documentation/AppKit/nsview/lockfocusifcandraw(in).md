# lockFocusIfCanDraw(in:)

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: method  
**Role**: Instance Method

Locks the focus to the view atomically if drawing can occur in the specified graphics context.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.4+ - Deprecated in 10.13

> **Deprecated**: Subclass the view and implement [`draw(_:)`](./draw%28_%29.md) instead.

## Declaration

```swift
func lockFocusIfCanDraw(in context: NSGraphicsContext) -> Bool
```

```objc
- (BOOL) lockFocusIfCanDrawInContext:(NSGraphicsContext *) context;
```

## Return Value

[`true`](../../Swift/true.md) if successful; otherwise, returns [`false`](../../Swift/false.md).

## Parameters

- `context`: The graphics context in which drawing might occur. See the discussion for the implications of the type of context.

### Deprecated methods
- [func lockFocus()](./lockfocus%28%29.md)
  Locks the focus on the view, so subsequent commands take effect in the view’s window and coordinate system.
- [func lockFocusIfCanDraw() -> Bool](./lockfocusifcandraw%28%29.md)
  Locks the focus to the view atomically if the `canDraw` method returns `true` and returns the value of `canDraw`.
- [func unlockFocus()](./unlockfocus%28%29.md)
  Unlocks focus from the current view.
- [func scroll(NSRect, by: NSSize)](./scroll%28_,by%29.md)
  Copies the visible portion of the view’s rendered image within a region and lays that portion down again at a specified offset .
- [func shouldDrawColor() -> Bool](./shoulddrawcolor%28%29.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the view is being drawn to an environment that supports color.
- [func allocateGState()](./allocategstate%28%29.md)
  Causes the view to maintain a private graphics state object, which encapsulates all parameters of the graphics environment.
- [func gState() -> Int](./gstate%28%29.md)
  Returns the identifier for the view’s graphics state object, or 0 if the view doesn’t have a graphics state object.
- [func setUpGState()](./setupgstate%28%29.md)
  Overridden by subclasses to (re)initialize the view’s graphics state object.
- [func renewGState()](./renewgstate%28%29.md)
  Invalidates the view’s graphics state object, if it has one.
- [func releaseGState()](./releasegstate%28%29.md)
  Frees the view’s graphics state object, if it has one.
- [func dragFile(String, from: NSRect, slideBack: Bool, event: NSEvent) -> Bool](./dragfile%28_,from,slideback,event%29.md)
  Initiates a dragging operation from the view, allowing the user to drag a file icon to any application that has window or view objects that accept files.
- [func dragPromisedFiles(ofTypes: [String], from: NSRect, source: Any, slideBack: Bool, event: NSEvent) -> Bool](./dragpromisedfiles%28oftypes,from,source,slideback,event%29.md)
  Initiates a dragging operation from the view, allowing the user to drag one or more promised files (or directories) into any application that has window or view objects that accept promised file data.
- [- convertPointToBase:](./convertpointtobase_.md)
  Converts the point from the view’s coordinate system to the base coordinate system.
- [- convertPointFromBase:](./convertpointfrombase_.md)
  Converts the point from the base coordinate system to the view’s coordinate system.
- [- convertSizeToBase:](./convertsizetobase_.md)
  Converts the size from the view’s coordinate system to the base coordinate system.
- [- convertSizeFromBase:](./convertsizefrombase_.md)
  Converts the size from the base coordinate system to the view’s coordinate system.
- [- convertRectToBase:](./convertrecttobase_.md)
  Converts the rectangle from the view’s coordinate system to the base coordinate system.
- [- convertRectFromBase:](./convertrectfrombase_.md)
  Converts the rectangle from the base coordinate system to the view’s coordinate system.
- [- performMnemonic:](./performmnemonic_.md)
  Implemented by subclasses to respond to mnemonics.
