# canDrawConcurrently

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: property

A Boolean value indicating whether the view can draw its contents on a background thread.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.6+

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
var canDrawConcurrently: Bool { get set }
```

#### Discussion

If your view’s [`draw(_:)`](nsview/draw(_:).md) implementation can draw safely on a background thread, set this property to [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/true). Doing so gives AppKit the ability to run your view’s drawing code off the app’s main thread, which can improve performance. The view’s window must also have its [`allowsConcurrentViewDrawing`](nswindow/allowsconcurrentviewdrawing.md) property set to [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/true) (the default) for threaded view drawing to occur.
