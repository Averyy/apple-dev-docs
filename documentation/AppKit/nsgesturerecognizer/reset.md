# reset()

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: method

Overridden to reset the internal state of the gesture recognizer when an attempt completes.

**Availability**:
- macOS ?+

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
func reset()
```

#### Discussion

AppKit calls this method after the gesture recognizer state has been set to any of the terminal states: [`NSGestureRecognizer.State.ended`](nsgesturerecognizer/state-swift.enum/ended.md), [`NSGestureRecognizer.State.cancelled`](nsgesturerecognizer/state-swift.enum/cancelled.md), [`NSGestureRecognizer.State.failed`](nsgesturerecognizer/state-swift.enum/failed.md), or [`recognized`](nsgesturerecognizer/state-swift.enum/recognized.md). Subclasses should override this method and use it to reset any internal state of the gesture recognizer in preparation for a new recognition attempt. After this method is called, the gesture recognizer receives no further updates for events that began but have not yet ended.
