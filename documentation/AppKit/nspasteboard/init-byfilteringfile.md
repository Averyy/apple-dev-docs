# init(byFilteringFile:)

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: init

**Availability**:
- macOS ?+

## Declaration

```swift
init(byFilteringFile filename: String)
```

#### Return Value

The new pasteboard object.

#### Discussion

No filter service is invoked until the data is actually requested, so invoking this method is reasonably inexpensive.
