#### Discussion

Use this constant in the [`orientation`](nsstackview/orientation.md) property to specify a vertical layout for the stack view. Use it to specify the vertical user interface axis for clipping resistance and hugging priority.

The leading, center, and trailing gravity areas in a vertical stack view are arranged top to bottom.
