# View Hierarchy

**Framework**: AppKit

Manage the subviews, superview, and window of a view and respond to notifications when the view hierarchy changes.

## Topics

### Getting the Related Objects
- [var superview: NSView?](nsview/superview.md)
  The view that is the parent of the current view.
- [var subviews: [NSView]](nsview/subviews.md)
  The array of views embedded in the current view.
- [var window: NSWindow?](nsview/window.md)
  The view’s window object, if it is installed in a window.
- [var opaqueAncestor: NSView?](nsview/opaqueancestor.md)
  The view’s closest opaque ancestor, which might be the view itself.
- [func isDescendant(of: NSView) -> Bool](nsview/isdescendant(of:).md)
  Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the view is a subview of the specified view.
- [func ancestorShared(with: NSView) -> NSView?](nsview/ancestorshared(with:).md)
  Returns the closest ancestor shared by the view and another specified view.
- [var enclosingMenuItem: NSMenuItem?](nsview/enclosingmenuitem.md)
  The menu item containing the view or any of its superviews in the view hierarchy.
- [var enclosingScrollView: NSScrollView?](nsview/enclosingscrollview.md)
  The nearest ancestor scroll view that contains the current view.
### Adding and Removing Subviews
- [func addSubview(NSView)](nsview/addsubview(_:).md)
  Adds a view to the view’s subviews so it’s displayed above its siblings.
- [func addSubview(NSView, positioned: NSWindow.OrderingMode, relativeTo: NSView?)](nsview/addsubview(_:positioned:relativeto:).md)
  Inserts a view among the view’s subviews so it’s displayed immediately above or below another view.
- [func removeFromSuperview()](nsview/removefromsuperview.md)
  Unlinks the view from its superview and its window, removes it from the responder chain, and invalidates its cursor rectangles.
- [func removeFromSuperviewWithoutNeedingDisplay()](nsview/removefromsuperviewwithoutneedingdisplay.md)
  Unlinks the view from its superview and its window and removes it from the responder chain, but does not invalidate its cursor rectangles to cause redrawing.
- [func replaceSubview(NSView, with: NSView)](nsview/replacesubview(_:with:).md)
  Replaces one of the view’s subviews with another view.
- [func sortSubviews((NSView, NSView, UnsafeMutableRawPointer?) -> ComparisonResult, context: UnsafeMutableRawPointer?)](nsview/sortsubviews(_:context:).md)
  Orders the view’s immediate subviews using the specified comparator function.
### Responding to View-Related Notifications
- [func didAddSubview(NSView)](nsview/didaddsubview(_:).md)
  Overridden by subclasses to perform additional actions when subviews are added to the view.
- [func viewDidMoveToSuperview()](nsview/viewdidmovetosuperview.md)
  Informs the view that its superview has changed (possibly to `nil`).
- [func viewDidMoveToWindow()](nsview/viewdidmovetowindow.md)
  Informs the view that it has been added to a new view hierarchy.
- [func viewWillMove(toSuperview: NSView?)](nsview/viewwillmove(tosuperview:).md)
  Informs the view that its superview is about to change to the specified superview (which may be `nil`).
- [func viewWillMove(toWindow: NSWindow?)](nsview/viewwillmove(towindow:).md)
  Informs the view that it’s being added to the view hierarchy of the specified window object (which may be `nil`).
- [func willRemoveSubview(NSView)](nsview/willremovesubview(_:).md)
  Overridden by subclasses to perform additional actions before subviews are removed from the view.
### Identifying Views by Tag
- [func viewWithTag(Int) -> NSView?](nsview/viewwithtag(_:).md)
  Returns the view’s nearest descendant (including itself) with a specific tag, or `nil` if no subview has that tag.
- [var tag: Int](nsview/tag.md)
  The view’s tag, which is an integer that you use to identify the view within your app.
