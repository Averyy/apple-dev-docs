# unlockFocus()

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: method  
**Role**: Instance Method

Removes the focus from the image.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.0+ - Deprecated in 27.0

> **Deprecated**: Use [`init(size:flipped:drawingHandler:)`](./init%28size,flipped,drawinghandler%29.md) instead.

## Declaration

```swift
func unlockFocus()
```

```objc
- (void) unlockFocus;
```

## Discussion

This message must be sent after a successful [`lockFocus()`](./lockfocus%28%29.md) or [`lockFocusOnRepresentation:`](./lockfocusonrepresentation_.md) message and the completion of any intermediate drawing commands. This method restores the focus to the previous owner, if any.

Do not send this message if the preceding call to lock focus raised an `NSImageCacheException`.
