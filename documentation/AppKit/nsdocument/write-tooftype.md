# write(to:ofType:)

**Framework**: Appkit  
**Kind**: method

Writes the contents of the document to a file or file package located by a URL, that is formatted to a specified type.

**Availability**:
- macOS ?+

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated
func write(to url: URL, ofType typeName: String) throws
```

#### Discussion

The default implementation of this method just invokes `[self fileWrapperOfType:typeName error:outError]` and writes the returned file wrapper to disk.

For backward binary compatibility with OS X v10.3 and earlier, the default implementation of this method instead invokes `[self writeToFile:[absoluteURL path] ofType:typeName]` if [`writeToFile:ofType:`](nsdocument/writetofile:oftype:.md) is overridden and the URL uses the `file:` scheme.

> **Note**:  In Swift, this method is marked with the `throws` keyword to indicate that it throws an error in cases of failure. When overriding this method, use the `throw` statement to throw an `NSError`, as described in [`Error Handling`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ErrorHandling.html) in [`The Swift Programming Language`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) and `About Imported Cocoa Error Parameters`.

## Parameters

- `url`: The location to which the document contents are written.
