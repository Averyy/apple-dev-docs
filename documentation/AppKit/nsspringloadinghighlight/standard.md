# NSSpringLoadingHighlight.standard

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: case

A constant that indicates standard highlighting to show the destination supports spring-loading.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.11+

## Declaration

```swift
case standard
```

#### Discussion

Apply light highlighting to the destination’s user interface. This highlighting style typically provides a subtle visual cue to the user that the destination supports spring-loading and that spring-loading is about to be fully engaged. A brief period of highlighting with this style provides the user with an opportunity to disengage and prevent the spring-loading from occurring.
