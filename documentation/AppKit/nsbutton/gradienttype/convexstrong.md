# NSButton.GradientType.convexStrong

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: case

As with `NSGradientConvexWeak`, the top-left corner is dark gray, and the bottom-right corner is light gray, but the difference between the grays is greater, so the appearance of sticking out is stronger.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.0+

## Declaration

case convexStrong
```
