#### Discussion

The value of this property is [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) if the button is transparent, [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) otherwise. A transparent button never draws itself, but it receives mouse events, sends its action, and tracks the mouse properly. A transparent button can be useful for sensitizing an area on the screen so that an action gets sent to a target when the area receives a mouse click. Setting this property causes the button to redraw if necessary.
