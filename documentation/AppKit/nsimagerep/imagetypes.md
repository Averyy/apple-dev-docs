# imageTypes

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: property

Returns an array of UTI strings identifying the image types supported by the image representation, either directly or through a user-installed filter service.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.5+

## Declaration

```swift
class var imageTypes: [String] { get }
```

#### Return Value

An array of `NSString` objects, each of which contains a UTI identifying a supported image type. Some sample image-related UTI strings include “`public.image`”, “`public.jpeg`”, and “`public.tiff`”. For a list of supported types, see `UTCoreTypes.h`.

#### Discussion

The returned list includes UTIs all file types supported by this image representation object plus those that can be opened by this image representation after being converted by a user-installed filter service. You can use the returned UTI strings with any method that supports UTIs.
