# priority

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: property  
**Role**: Instance Property

The priority of the constraint.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.7+

## Declaration

```swift
var priority: NSLayoutConstraint.Priority { get set }
```

```objc
@property NSLayoutPriority priority;
```

#### Discussion

By default, all constraints are required; this property is set to [`required`](./priority-swift.struct/required.md) in macOS or `UILayoutPriorityRequired` in iOS.

If a constraint’s priority level is less than [`required`](./priority-swift.struct/required.md) in macOS or `UILayoutPriorityRequired` in iOS, then it is optional. Higher priority constraints are satisfied before lower priority constraints; however, optional constraint satisfaction is not all or nothing. If a constraint `a == b` is optional, the constraint-based layout system will attempt to minimize `abs(a-b)`.

Priorities may not change from nonrequired to required, or from required to nonrequired. An exception will be thrown if a priority of [`required`](./priority-swift.struct/required.md) in macOS or `UILayoutPriorityRequired` in iOS is changed to a lower priority, or if a lower priority is changed to a required priority after the constraints is added to a view. Changing from one optional priority to another optional priority is allowed even after the constraint is installed on a view.

Priorities must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to [`required`](./priority-swift.struct/required.md) in macOS or `UILayoutPriorityRequired` in iOS.

  Layout priority used to indicate the relative importance of constraints, allowing Auto Layout to make appropriate tradeoffs when satisfying the constraints of the system as a whole.
