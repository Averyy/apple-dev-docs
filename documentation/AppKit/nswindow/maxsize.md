# maxSize

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: property

The maximum size to which the window’s frame (including its title bar) can be sized.

**Availability**:
- macOS ?+

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
var maxSize: NSSize { get set }
```

#### Discussion

The maximum size constraint is enforced for resizing by the user as well as for the `setFrame...` methods other than [`setFrame(_:display:)`](nswindow/setframe(_:display:).md) and [`setFrame(_:display:animate:)`](nswindow/setframe(_:display:animate:).md). Note that the window server limits window sizes to 10,000.

The default maximum size of a window is `{FLT_MAX, FLT_MAX}` (`FLT_MAX` is defined in `/usr/include/float.h`). When the maximum size of a window has been set, there is no way to reset it other than by specifying this default maximum size.

The [`contentMaxSize`](nswindow/contentmaxsize.md) property takes precedence over this property.
