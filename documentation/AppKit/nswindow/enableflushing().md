# enableFlushing()

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: method  
**Role**: Instance Method

Reenables the [`flush()`](./flush%28%29.md) method for the window after it was disabled through a previous [`disableFlushing()`](./disableflushing%28%29.md) message.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.0+ - Deprecated in 10.14

> **Deprecated**: Use +[NSAnimationContext runAnimationGroup:completionHandler:] to perform atomic updates across runloop invocations.

## Declaration

```swift
func enableFlushing()
```

- [func flushIfNeeded()](./flushifneeded%28%29.md)

  Begins a dragging session.
- [- convertBaseToScreen:](./convertbasetoscreen_.md)
  Converts a given point from the window’s base coordinate system to the screen coordinate system.
