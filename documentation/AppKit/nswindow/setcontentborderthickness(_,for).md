# setContentBorderThickness(_:for:)

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: method  
**Role**: Instance Method

Specifies the thickness of a given border of the window.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.5+

## Declaration

```swift
func setContentBorderThickness(_ thickness: CGFloat, for edge: NSRectEdge)
```

```objc
- (void) setContentBorderThickness:(CGFloat) thickness forEdge:(NSRectEdge) edge;
```

## Discussion

In a nontextured window calling `setContentBorderThickness:forEdge:` passing `NSMaxYEdge` will raise an exception (in a nontextured window, it’s only valid to set the content border thickness of the bottom edge). It is only valid to set the content border thickness of the top edge in a textured window.

Typically, if you call `setContentBorderThickness:forEdge:`, you should also call `setAutorecalculatesContentBorderThickness:NO forEdge:`.

The `contentBorder` does not include the title bar or toolbar, so a textured window that just wants the gradient in the title bar and toolbar should have a `thickness` of `0` for `NSMaxYEdge`.

## Parameters

- `thickness`: The thickness for `edge`, in points.
- `edge`: The border whose thickness to set:

  - `NSMaxYEdge`: Top border.
  - `NSMinYEdge`: Bottom border.
