# characters

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: property

The characters associated with a key-up or key-down event.

**Availability**:
- macOS ?+

## Declaration

```swift
var characters: String? { get }
```

#### Discussion

These characters are derived from a keyboard mapping that associates various key combinations with Unicode characters. This property is only valid for key-up and key-down events. It raises an `NSInternalInconsistencyException` if accessed on any other kind of event object.

This property is set to an empty string for dead keys, such as Option-e. However, for a key combination such as Option-Shift-e this property is set to the standard accent (“´”).

For a list of constants corresponding to commonly-used Unicode characters, see [`NSText`](nstext.md).
