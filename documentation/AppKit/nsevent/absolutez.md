# absoluteZ

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: property

The absolute z coordinate of pointing device on its tablet at full tablet resolution.

**Availability**:
- macOS ?+

## Declaration

```swift
var absoluteZ: Int { get }
```

#### Discussion

For the coordinate to be valid, this event must be generated by a tablet pointing device (otherwise the property is set to `0`). The z coordinate does not represent pressure. It registers the depth coordinate returned by some tablet devices with wheels; if the device is something other than these, `0` is returned. This method is valid only for mouse events with a subtype of `NSTabletPointEventSubtype` and for events of type `NSTabletPoint`.
