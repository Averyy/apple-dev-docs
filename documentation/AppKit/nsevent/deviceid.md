# deviceID

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: property  
**Role**: Instance Property

A special identifier the system matches against tablet-pointer and tablet-proximity events.

**Availability**:
- macOS

## Declaration

```swift
var deviceID: Int { get }
```

```objc
@property (readonly) NSUInteger deviceID;
```

## Discussion

All tablet-pointer events generated in the period between the device entering and leaving tablet proximity have the same device ID. This property is valid only for mouse events with subtype `NSTabletPointEventSubtype` or `NSTabletProximityEventSubtype`, and for `NSTabletPoint` and `NSTabletProximity` events.
