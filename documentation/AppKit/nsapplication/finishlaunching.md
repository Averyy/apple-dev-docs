# finishLaunching()

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: method

Activates the app, opens any files specified by the `NSOpen` user default, and unhighlights the app’s icon.

**Availability**:

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
func finishLaunching()
```

#### Discussion

The [`run()`](nsapplication/run().md) method calls this method before it starts the event loop. When this method begins, it posts an [`willFinishLaunchingNotification`](nsapplication/willfinishlaunchingnotification.md) to the default notification center. If you override [`finishLaunching()`](nsapplication/finishlaunching().md), the subclass method should invoke the superclass method.
