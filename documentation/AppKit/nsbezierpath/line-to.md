# line(to:)

**Framework**: AppKit  
**Kind**: method

Appends a straight line to the path.

**Availability**:
- macOS ?+

## Declaration

```swift
func line(to point: NSPoint)
```

#### Discussion

This method creates a straight line segment starting at the current point and ending at the point specified by the  `aPoint` parameter. The current point is the last point in the receiver’s most recently added segment.

You must set the path’s current point (using the [`move(to:)`](nsbezierpath/move(to:).md) method or through the creation of a preceding line or curve segment) before you invoke this method. If the path is empty, this method raises an [`genericException`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsexceptionname/1412113-genericexception) exception.

## Parameters

- `point`: The destination point of the line segment, specified in the current coordinate system.
