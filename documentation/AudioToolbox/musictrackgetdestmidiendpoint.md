## Declaration

```swift
func MusicTrackGetDestMIDIEndpoint(_ inTrack: MusicTrack, _ outEndpoint: UnsafeMutablePointer<MIDIEndpointRef>) -> OSStatus
```

#### Return Value

A result code. If the music track’s event target is an audio unit node, returns `kAudioToolboxErr_IllegalTrackDestination`.

## Parameters
