## Declaration

```swift
func MusicTrackSetDestNode(_ inTrack: MusicTrack, _ inNode: AUNode) -> OSStatus
```

#### Return Value

A result code.

#### Discussion

The audio unit node that you specify must be a member of the audio processing graph that the music track’s sequence is using. When played, the track sends its events to that node.

## Parameters

- `inTrack`: The music track that you want to set a target audio unit node for.
- `inNode`: The node that you specifying as the target for music track.
