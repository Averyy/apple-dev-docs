#### Discussion

A music track (of type `MusicTrack`) has properties which may be inspected and assigned, including support for looping, muting/soloing, and time-stamp interpretation. You can iterate through the events in a music track, and can perform various editing operations on them.

A music track is a component of a music sequence (of type [`MusicSequence`](./musicsequence.md)), which in turn is played by a music player (of type [`MusicPlayer`](./musicplayer.md)).
