## Declaration

```swift
func MusicTrackMoveEvents(_ inTrack: MusicTrack, _ inStartTime: MusicTimeStamp, _ inEndTime: MusicTimeStamp, _ inMoveTime: MusicTimeStamp) -> OSStatus
```

#### Return Value

A result code.

#### Discussion

The `inStartTime` value must be less than the `inEndTime` value.

## Parameters

- `inTrack`: The track whose events you want to move forward or backward in time.
- `inStartTime`: The current start time, in beats, for the music track events you want to move.
- `inEndTime`: The current end time, in beats, for the music track events you want to move.
- `inMoveTime`: The number of beats to move the specified range of music track events. A positive value moves the events toward the end of the music track; a negative value moves the events toward the start.
