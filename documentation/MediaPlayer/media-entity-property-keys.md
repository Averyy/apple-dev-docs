# Media entity property keys

**Framework**: Media Player

The property keys used to retrieve metadata for media entities.

#### Overview

You obtain metadata for a media entity by calling the [`value(forProperty:)`](mpmediaentity/value(forproperty:).md) method with these property keys. You can also use some properties to build media property predicates, as described in [`MPMediaPropertyPredicate`](mpmediapropertypredicate.md). These properties are filterable.

## Topics

### Constants
