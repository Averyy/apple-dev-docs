#### Discussion

This property reports the clean aperture of the video in square pixels. Thus, the reported dimensions take into account anamorphic content and aperture modes.

It is possible for the natural size of a movie to change during playback. This typically happens when the bit-rate of streaming content changes or when playback toggles between audio-only and a combination of audio and video.
