## Declaration

```swift
let kCMSampleBufferAttachmentKey_DroppedFrameReason: CFString
```

#### Discussion

Sample buffers with this attachment contain no image or data buffer.  They mark a dropped video        frame.  This attachment identifies the reason the frame was dropped. The value for this key is one of the string constants in `Sample Buffer Dropped Frame Reasons`.
