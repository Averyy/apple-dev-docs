# decodeTimeStamp

**Framework**: Core Media  
**Kind**: property

The decode timestamp of the first sample in the buffer.

**Availability**:
- iOS 13.0+
- iPadOS 13.0+
- Mac Catalyst ?+
- macOS 10.15+
- tvOS 13.0+
- visionOS 1.0+
- watchOS 6.0+

## Declaration

```swift
var decodeTimeStamp: CMTime { get }
```

#### Discussion

The system expects sample buffers to store samples in their decode order, even if their presentation order is different.

This value is [`invalid`](cmtime/invalid.md) if there’s an error.
