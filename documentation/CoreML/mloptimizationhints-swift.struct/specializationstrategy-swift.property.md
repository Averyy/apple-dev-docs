## Declaration

```swift
var specializationStrategy: MLOptimizationHints.SpecializationStrategy
```

#### Discussion

Core ML segments the model’s compute graph and specializes each segment for the target compute device. This process can affect the model loading time and the prediction latency.

Use this option to tailor the specialization strategy for your model.
