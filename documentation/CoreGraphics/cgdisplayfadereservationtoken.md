**Framework**: Core Graphics  
**Kind**: typealias

A token issued by Quartz when reserving one or more displays for a fade operation during a specified interval.

## Declaration

```swift
typealias CGDisplayFadeReservationToken = UInt32
```

#### Discussion

Quartz lets you reserve the display hardware to perform a fade operation. Fade reservations are valid for up to 15 seconds. Only one token is needed for both fade-out and fade-in.

You should release a fade reservation immediately when you no longer need it. If the reservation expires, releasing it is safe but not necessary.
