# CGPathAddRects

**Framework**: Core Graphics  
**Kind**: func  
**Role**: Function

Appends an array of rectangles to a mutable graphics path.

**Availability**:
- iOS 2.0+
- iPadOS 2.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- macOS 10.2+
- tvOS
- visionOS 1.0+
- watchOS 2.0+

## Declaration

```c
extern void CGPathAddRects(CGMutablePathRef path, const CGAffineTransform *m, const CGRect *rects, size_t count);
```

#### Discussion

This is a convenience function that adds an array of rectangles to a path. This function is equivalent to repeatedly calling the [`CGPathAddRect`](./cgpathaddrect.md) function to append the sequence of rectangles.

## Parameters

- `path`: The mutable path to change.
- `m`: An affine transformation matrix, or `NULL` if no transformation is needed. If specified, Core Graphics applies the transformation to the rectangles before adding them to the path.
- `rects`: The array of new rectangles to add.
- `count`: The number of elements in the array.
