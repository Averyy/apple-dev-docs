# Loading Resources (Legacy)

**Framework**: WebKit

## Topics

### Loading Resources (Legacy)
- [class WebResource](webresource.md)
  A `WebResource` object represents a downloaded URL. It encapsulates the data of the download as well as other resource properties such as the URL, MIME type, and frame name.
- [protocol WebResourceLoadDelegate](webresourceloaddelegate.md)
  Web view resource load delegates implement this protocol to be notified on the progress of loading individual resources. Note that there can be hundreds of resources, such as images and other media, per page. So, if you just want to get page loading status see the WebFrameLoadDelegate protocol.
