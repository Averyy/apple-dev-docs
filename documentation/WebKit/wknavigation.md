#### Overview

A [`WKNavigation`](wknavigation.md) object uniquely identifies a load request for a webpage. When you ask a web view to load content or navigate to a page, the web view returns a [`WKNavigation`](wknavigation.md) object that identifies your request. As the load operation progresses, the web view reports progress of that operation to various methods of its navigation delegate, passing them the matching [`WKNavigation`](wknavigation.md) object.
