### Archiving Webpages (Legacy)
- [class WebArchive](webarchive.md)
  A WebArchive object represents a webpage that can be archived—for example, archived on disk or on the pasteboard. A WebArchive object contains the main resource, as well as the subresources and subframes of the main resource. The main resource can be an entire webpage, a portion of a webpage, or some other kind of data such as an image. Use this class to archive webpages, or place a portion of a webpage on the pasteboard, or to represent rich web content in any application.
