#### Discussion

This function displays the player onscreen if the player is not currently displayed and a video is played. For audio, this function will display the player only the first time audio is played. To display the player for audio after the first time, use the [`present`](player/1627418-present.md) function. Only a single player can be active at a time. Calling the `play` function on a [`Player`](player.md) object will stop any players currently playing.
