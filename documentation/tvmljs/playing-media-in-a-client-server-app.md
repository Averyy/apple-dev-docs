# Playing Media in a Client-Server App

**Framework**: TVMLKit JS

Play media items in a client-server app using the built-in media player for TVMLKit JS.

**Availability**:
- tvOS 12.0+

#### Overview

The TVML frameworks provide several built-in ways to play media items. After loading the initial page, the app automatically plays music in the background. The user navigates between two images and the app loads and plays a video or audio media item after the user selects an image. Both of these media items play using the built-in TVMLJKit JS media player.
