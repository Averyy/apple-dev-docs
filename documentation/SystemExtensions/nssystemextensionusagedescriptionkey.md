## Declaration

```swift
let NSSystemExtensionUsageDescriptionKey: String
```

#### Discussion

This key is required for all system extensions except DriverKit extensions, and must be in the extension’s `Info.plist` file. Failure to include this key results in an error at activation time. For DriverKit extensions, use [`OSBundleUsageDescriptionKey`](osbundleusagedescriptionkey.md) instead.
