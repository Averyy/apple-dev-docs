# os_unfair_lock_trylock

**Framework**: os  
**Kind**: func  
**Role**: Function

Locks an unfair lock if it is not already locked.

**Availability**:
- iOS 10.0+
- iPadOS 10.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- macOS 10.12+

- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```c
extern bool os_unfair_lock_trylock(os_unfair_lock_t lock);
```

## Return Value

`true` if the lock was successfully locked, or `false` if the lock was already locked.

## Discussion

If this function returns `false`, you must either proceed without having acquired the lock or call [`os_unfair_lock_lock`](./os_unfair_lock_lock.md) directly. Do not attempt to call this function within a retry loop; [`os_unfair_lock_lock`](./os_unfair_lock_lock.md) accomplishes the same task, without hiding the lock waiter from the system or preventing resolution of priority inversions.

## Parameters

- `lock`: A pointer to the unfair lock to be locked.
