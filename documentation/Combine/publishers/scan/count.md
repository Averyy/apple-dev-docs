## Declaration

```swift
func count() -> Publishers.Count<Self>
```

#### Return Value

A publisher that consumes all elements until the upstream publisher finishes, then emits a single value with the total number of elements received.

#### Discussion

Use [`count()`](publisher/count().md) to determine the number of elements received from the upstream publisher before it completes:

```swift
let numbers = (0...10)
cancellable = numbers.publisher
    .count()
    .sink { print("\($0)") }

// Prints: "11"
```
