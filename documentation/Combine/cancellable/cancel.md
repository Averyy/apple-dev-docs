#### Discussion

When implementing [`Cancellable`](cancellable.md) in support of a custom publisher, implement `cancel()` to request that your publisher stop calling its downstream subscribers. Combine doesn’t require that the publisher stop immediately, but the `cancel()` call should take effect quickly. Canceling should also eliminate any strong references it currently holds.

After you receive one call to `cancel()`, subsequent calls shouldn’t do anything. Additionally, your implementation must be thread-safe, and it shouldn’t block the caller.

> 💡 **Tip**: Keep in mind that your `cancel()` may execute concurrently with another call to `cancel()` — including the scenario where an [`AnyCancellable`](anycancellable.md) is deallocating — or to [`request(_:)`](subscription/request(_:).md).
