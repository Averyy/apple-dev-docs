# Generating reader tokens for the Verifier API

**Framework**: ProximityReader

Configure your server to generate reader tokens to prepare a device for mobile document reading.

#### Overview

The Verifier API supports displaying your brand’s name and logo in the reader UI during a document request. To show your brand’s name and logo, your app needs to pass a reader token as an argument to the [`prepare(using:)`](mobiledocumentreader/prepare(using:).md) method.

Reader tokens are JSON Web Tokens (JWT) generated by your server containing your brand ID, key ID, and a reader instance identifier. You can obtain a brand ID and key ID by enrolling with [`Apple Business Register`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://register.apple.com/services/login?returnTo=/signin/id-verifier).

The person who enrolls your organization with [`Apple Business Register`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://register.apple.com/services/login?returnTo=/signin/id-verifier) will need to enter your company’s business name, and upload your brand’s logo and a public signing key.

#### Generate a Reader Token on Your Server

You need to link a reader token to the device that you’ll use to read documents, as well as your brand information from Apple Business Register. To generate a reader token:

1. Fetch the device’s [`readerInstanceIdentifier`](mobiledocumentreader/configuration-swift.struct/readerinstanceidentifier.md).
2. Send the reader instance identifier to your server.
3. On your server, create a JWT containing the device’s reader instance identifier, along with your brand and key IDs from [`Apple Business Register`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://register.apple.com/services/login?returnTo=/signin/id-verifier).
4. Sign the JWT with your server’s private signing key and return the token to your app.

After creating the reader token, confirm the validity of the token authorization by calling [`prepare(using:)`](mobiledocumentreader/prepare(using:).md). If the method returns successfully, the framework returns a [`MobileDocumentReaderSession`](mobiledocumentreadersession.md) and the device is ready to read mobile documents. After using a reader token to prepare a reader device, your app can cache and reuse it for up to 48 hours.

A JWT has two sections, a header and a payload. The header describes the token and the cryptographic operations applied to the payload. The payload contains a set of cryptographically signed claims.

Construct a token with these fields in the header:

In the payload section of the token, include the following:

When decoded, a token for use with the Verifier API has the following format:

```json
{
    "alg": "ES256",
    "kid": "ABCDEFGHIJ",
    "typ": "JWT"
}
{
    "aud": "apple-identityservices-v1",
    "iss": "KLMNOPQRST",
    "sub": "UVWXYZ1234",
    "iat": 1685980800,
    "exp": 1685981100
}
```

To learn more about JWT, see the [`JSON Web Token (JWT) specification`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519). You can find a collection of libraries for generating signed tokens at [`JWT.io`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://jwt.io).
