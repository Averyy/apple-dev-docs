```

#### Discussion

The [`SHA2_384`](sha2_384.md) hash implements the [`HashFunction`](hashfunction.md) protocol for the specific case of SHA-2 hashing with a 384-bit digest ([`SHA384Digest`](sha384digest.md)). Larger digests take more space but are more secure.

You can compute the digest by calling the static `hash(data:)` method once. Alternatively, if the data that you want to hash is too large to fit in memory, you can compute the digest iteratively by creating a new hash instance, calling the `update(data:)` method repeatedly with blocks of data, and then calling the `finalize()` method to get the result.
