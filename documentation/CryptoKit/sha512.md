## Declaration

```swift
struct SHA512
```

#### Overview

The [`SHA512`](sha512.md) hash implements the [`HashFunction`](hashfunction.md) protocol for the specific case of SHA-2 hashing with a 512-bit digest ([`SHA512Digest`](sha512digest.md)). Larger digests take more space but are more secure.

You can compute the digest by calling the static `hash(data:)` method once. Alternatively, if the data that you want to hash is too large to fit in memory, you can compute the digest iteratively by creating a new hash instance, calling the `update(data:)` method repeatedly with blocks of data, and then calling the [`finalize()`](sha512/finalize().md) method to get the result.

## Topics

### Specifying the output type
- [typealias Digest](sha512/digest.md)
  The digest type for a SHA512 hash function.
- [struct SHA512Digest](sha512digest.md)
  The output of a Secure Hashing Algorithm 2 (SHA-2) hash with a 512-bit digest.
### Computing a hash iteratively
- [init()](sha512/init.md)
  Creates a SHA512 hash function.
- [func update(bufferPointer: UnsafeRawBufferPointer)](sha512/update(bufferpointer:).md)
  Incrementally updates the hash function with the contents of the buffer.
- [func finalize() -> SHA512.Digest](sha512/finalize.md)
  Finalizes the hash function and returns the computed digest.
### Inspecting hash information
- [static let byteCount: Int](sha512/bytecount.md)
  The number of bytes in a SHA512 digest.
- [static let blockByteCount: Int](sha512/blockbytecount.md)
  The number of bytes that represents the hash function’s internal state.
