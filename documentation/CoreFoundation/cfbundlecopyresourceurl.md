## Declaration

```swift
func CFBundleCopyResourceURL(_ bundle: CFBundle!, _ resourceName: CFString!, _ resourceType: CFString!, _ subDirName: CFString!) -> CFURL!
```

#### Return Value

A CFURL object describing the location of the requested resource, or `NULL` if the resource cannot be found. Ownership follows the [`The Create Rule`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFMemoryMgmt/Concepts/Ownership.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001148-103029).

#### Discussion

For example, if a bundle contains a subdirectory `WaterSounds` that includes a file `Water1.aiff`, you can retrieve the URL for the file using:

```objc
CFBundleCopyResourceURL(bundle, CFSTR("Water1"), CFSTR("aiff"), CFSTR("WaterSounds"));
```

## Parameters

- `bundle`: The bundle to examine.
- `resourceName`: The name of the requested resource.
- `resourceType`: The abstract type of the requested resource. The type is expressed as a filename extension, such as  . Pass   if   is the complete name of the file you’re looking for, including any extension.
- `subDirName`: The name of the subdirectory of the bundle’s resources directory to search. Pass   to search the standard CFBundle resource locations.
