# CFDictionaryGetCountOfValue(_:_:)

**Framework**: Core Foundation  
**Kind**: func  
**Role**: Function

Counts the number of times a given value occurs in the dictionary.

**Availability**:

## Declaration

```swift
func CFDictionaryGetCountOfValue(_ theDict: CFDictionary!, _ value: UnsafeRawPointer!) -> CFIndex
```

```c
extern CFIndex CFDictionaryGetCountOfValue(CFDictionaryRef theDict, const void *value);
```

#### Return Value

The number of times the `value` occurs in `theDict`.

## Parameters

- `theDict`: The dictionary to examine.
- `value`: The value for which to find matches in `theDict`. The value equal callback provided when the dictionary was created is used to compare. If the equal callback was `NULL`, pointer equality (in C, ==) is used. If `value`, or any other value in the dictionary, is not understood by the equal callback, the behavior is undefined.
