#### Discussion

The Brotli compression algorithm is a widely adopted content encoding method for the web. The Compression framework includes Brotli to provide decoding capabilities.

The Compression framework implements the Brotli level 2 encoder only. This compression level provides a good balance between compression speed and compression ratio. The Brotli decoder supports decoding data compressed with any compression level.
