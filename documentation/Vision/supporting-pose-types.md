# Supporting Pose Types

**Framework**: Vision

Types you use when working with pose analysis.

#### Overview

Use these types when working with pose detection results to access joint information and properties.

## Topics

### Joints
- [struct Joint](joint.md)
  A pose joint represented as a normalized point in an image, along with a label and a confidence value.
- [struct Joint3D](joint3d.md)
  An object that represents a body pose joint in 3D space.
### Handedness
- [enum Chirality](chirality.md)
  The hand sidedness of a pose.

## See Also

- [struct DetectAnimalBodyPoseRequest](detectanimalbodyposerequest.md)
  A request that detects an animal body pose.
- [class DetectHumanBodyPose3DRequest](detecthumanbodypose3drequest.md)
  A request that detects points on human bodies in 3D space, relative to the camera.
- [struct DetectHumanBodyPoseRequest](detecthumanbodyposerequest.md)
  A request that detects a human body pose.
- [struct DetectHumanHandPoseRequest](detecthumanhandposerequest.md)
  A request that detects a human hand pose.
