  The names of the available joints in the observation.
- [VNHumanHandPoseObservation.JointName](vnhumanhandposeobservation/jointname.md)
  The supported joint names for the hand pose.
- [var availableJointsGroupNames: [VNHumanHandPoseObservation.JointsGroupName]](vnhumanhandposeobservation/availablejointsgroupnames.md)
  The joint group names available in the observation.
- [VNHumanHandPoseObservation.JointsGroupName](vnhumanhandposeobservation/jointsgroupname.md)
  The supported joint group names for the hand pose.
- [func recognizedPoint(VNHumanHandPoseObservation.JointName) throws -> VNRecognizedPoint](vnhumanhandposeobservation/recognizedpoint(_:).md)
  Retrieves the recognized point for a joint name.
- [func recognizedPoints(VNHumanHandPoseObservation.JointsGroupName) throws -> [VNHumanHandPoseObservation.JointName : VNRecognizedPoint]](vnhumanhandposeobservation/recognizedpoints(_:).md)
  Retrieves the recognized points associated with the joint group name.
### Determining the Chirality
