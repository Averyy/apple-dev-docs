## Declaration

```swift
class VNPoint3D
```

## Topics

### Creating a Point
- [init?(position: simd_float4x4)](vnpoint3d/init(position:).md)
  Creates a point object with the position you specify.
- [init?(coder: NSCoder)](vnpoint3d/init(coder:).md)
### Getting the Position
- [var position: simd_float4x4](vnpoint3d/position.md)
  The three-dimensional position.
