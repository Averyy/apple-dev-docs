# preferBackgroundProcessing

**Framework**: Vision  
**Kind**: property

A hint to minimize the resource burden of the request.

**Availability**:
- iOS 11.0+
- iPadOS 11.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- macOS 10.13+
- tvOS 11.0+

## Declaration

```swift
var preferBackgroundProcessing: Bool { get set }
```

#### Discussion

If set to [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/true), this property reduces the request’s memory footprint, processing footprint, and CPU/GPU contention at the potential cost of longer execution time.

Setting this value can help ensure that Vision processing doesn’t block UI updates and other rendering on the main thread.
