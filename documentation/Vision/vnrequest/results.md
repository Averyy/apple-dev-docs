#### Discussion

If the request fails, this property is [`nil`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ObjectiveC/nil-227m0). Otherwise, it contains an array of [`VNObservation`](vnobservation.md) subclasses specific to the [`VNRequest`](vnrequest.md) subclass.

Don’t access this property until the request has finished processing.
