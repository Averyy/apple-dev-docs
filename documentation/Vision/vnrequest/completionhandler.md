# completionHandler

**Framework**: Vision  
**Kind**: property

The completion handler the system invokes after the request finishes processing.

**Availability**:
- iOS 11.0+
- iPadOS 11.0+

- macOS 10.13+
- tvOS 11.0+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
var completionHandler: VNRequestCompletionHandler? { get }
```

#### Discussion

Vision executes the completion handler on the same queue that it executes the request; however, this queue differs from the one where you called [`perform(_:)`](vnimagerequesthandler/perform(_:).md).
