func didReceiveEvent(_ event: DDDeviceEvent)
```

#### Discussion

The system calls this function to give the app’s `DDDiscoveryExtension` information about the device. For example, when someone selects the device in the AirPlay menu ([`AVRoutePickerView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AVKit/AVRoutePickerView)), the system notifies the extension of the state change by invoking this callback.

## Parameters

- `event`: A moment of interest in the device discovery life cycle.
