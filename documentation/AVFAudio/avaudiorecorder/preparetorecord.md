## Declaration

```swift
func prepareToRecord() -> Bool
```

#### Return Value

[`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) if successful; otherwise, [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false).

#### Discussion

Calling this method creates an audio file at the URL you used to create the recorder. If a file already exists at that location, this method overwrites it.

Call this method to start recording as quickly as possible upon calling [`record()`](avaudiorecorder/record().md).
