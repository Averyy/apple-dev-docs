## Declaration

```swift
optional func speechSynthesizer(_ synthesizer: AVSpeechSynthesizer, didContinue utterance: AVSpeechUtterance)
```

#### Discussion

The system only calls this method if a speech synthesizer pauses speaking and the system calls its [`pauseSpeaking(at:)`](avspeechsynthesizer/pausespeaking(at:).md) method. The system doesn’t call this method if the synthesizer pauses while in a delay between utterances.

## Parameters

- `synthesizer`: The speech synthesizer that resumes speaking the utterance.
- `utterance`: The utterance that the speech synthesizer resumes speaking.
