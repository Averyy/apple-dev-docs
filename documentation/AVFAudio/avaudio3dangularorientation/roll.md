#### Discussion

The roll axis describes the tilt of the listener’s head, and is perpendicular to the other two axes. Its origin is at the center of the listener’s head and points toward the listener’s nose. A positive roll is to the right going from `0` to `180` degrees. A negative roll is to the left going from `0` to `-180` degrees.
