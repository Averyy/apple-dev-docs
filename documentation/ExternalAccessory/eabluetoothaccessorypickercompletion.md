#### Discussion

You use this block to process results generated by the [`showBluetoothAccessoryPicker(withNameFilter:completion:)`](eaaccessorymanager/showbluetoothaccessorypicker(withnamefilter:completion:).md) method. The block receives an [`NSError`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSError) object as its only parameter. If no error occurred, this parameter is set to `nil`.
