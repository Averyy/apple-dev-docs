## Declaration

```swift
func performCustomValidation(forMapping mapping: NSEntityMapping, manager: NSMigrationManager) throws
```

#### Discussion

This method is called before the default save validation is performed by the framework.

If you implement this method, you must manually obtain the collection of objects you are interested in validating.

## Parameters

- `mapping`: The mapping object in use.
- `manager`: The migration manager performing the migration.
