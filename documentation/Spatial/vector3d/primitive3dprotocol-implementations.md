### Instance Methods
- [func applying(AffineTransform3D) -> Vector3D](vector3d/applying(_:)-1d0mh.md)
  Returns the vector that results from applying an affine transform to the vector.
- [func applying(Pose3D) -> Vector3D](vector3d/applying(_:)-4k2qi.md)
  Returns a vector that results from applying the specified pose.
- [func unapplying(Pose3D) -> Vector3D](vector3d/unapplying(_:)-1gzyd.md)
  Returns a vector that results from unapplying the specified pose.
- [func unapplying(AffineTransform3D) -> Vector3D](vector3d/unapplying(_:)-6vl3o.md)
  Returns the vector that results from unapplying an affine transform to the vector.
- [func unapplying(ProjectiveTransform3D) -> Vector3D](vector3d/unapplying(_:)-8ookb.md)
  Returns the vector that results from unapplying a projective transform to the vector.
