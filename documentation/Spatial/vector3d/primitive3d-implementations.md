### Instance Methods
- [func applying(AffineTransform3D) -> Vector3D](vector3d/applying(_:)-1d0mh.md)
  Returns the vector resulting from applying an affine transform to the vector.
- [func applying(Pose3D) -> Vector3D](vector3d/applying(_:)-4k2qi.md)
  Returns a vector that results from applying the specified pose.
- [func applying(ProjectiveTransform3D) -> Vector3D](vector3d/applying(_:)-5y3xb.md)
  Returns the vector resulting from applying a projective transform to the vector.
- [func unapplying(Pose3D) -> Vector3D](vector3d/unapplying(_:)-1gzyd.md)
  Returns a vector that results from unapplying the specified pose.
- [func unapplying(AffineTransform3D) -> Vector3D](vector3d/unapplying(_:)-6vl3o.md)
