**Framework**: Spatial

## Topics

### Operators
- [static func + (Vector3D, Vector3D) -> Vector3D](vector3d/+(_:_:)-7gbcj.md)
  Returns a vector that’s the element-wise sum of two sizes.
- [static func += (inout Vector3D, Vector3D)](vector3d/+=(_:_:).md)
  Adds two vectors and stores the result in the left-hand-side variable.
- [static func - (Vector3D, Vector3D) -> Vector3D](vector3d/-(_:_:)-6zam.md)
  Returns a size that’s the element-wise difference of two vectors.
- [static func -= (inout Vector3D, Vector3D)](vector3d/-=(_:_:).md)
  Subtracts a vector from a vector and stores the difference in the left-hand-side variable.
