**Framework**: Spatial

## Topics

### Operators
- [static func + (Vector3DFloat, Vector3DFloat) -> Vector3DFloat](vector3dfloat/+(_:_:)-5a0s0.md)
  Returns the vector that’s the element-wise sum of a vector and a vector.
- [static func += (inout Vector3DFloat, Vector3DFloat)](vector3dfloat/+=(_:_:).md)
  Calculates the vector that’s the element-wise sum of a vector and a vector and stores the result in the left-hand-side variable.
- [static func - (Vector3DFloat, Vector3DFloat) -> Vector3DFloat](vector3dfloat/-(_:_:)-87qbd.md)
  Returns the vector that’s the element-wise difference of a vector and a vector.
- [static func -= (inout Vector3DFloat, Vector3DFloat)](vector3dfloat/-=(_:_:).md)
  Calculates the vector that’s the element-wise difference of a vector and a vector and stores the result in the left-hand-side variable.
