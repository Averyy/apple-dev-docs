#### Discussion

Returns the smallest rectangle with integer coordinates that contains the source rectangle.

A rectangle with the smallest integer values for its origin and size that contains the source rectangle. That is, given a rectangle with fractional origin or size values, integral rounds the rectangle’s origin downward and its size upward to the nearest whole integers, such that the result contains the original rectangle.
