**Framework**: Spatial

## Topics

### Operators
- [static func + (Size3D, Size3D) -> Size3D](size3d/+(_:_:).md)
  Returns a size that’s the element-wise sum of two sizes.
- [static func += (inout Size3D, Size3D)](size3d/+=(_:_:)-75tn3.md)
  Adds two size structures and stores the result in the left-hand-side variable.
- [static func - (Size3D, Size3D) -> Size3D](size3d/-(_:_:).md)
  Returns a size that’s the element-wise difference of two points.
- [static func -= (inout Size3D, Size3D)](size3d/-=(_:_:)-8t5kg.md)
  Subtracts a size from a size and stores the difference in the left-hand-side variable.
