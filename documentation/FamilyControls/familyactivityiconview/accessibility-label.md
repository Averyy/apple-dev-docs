#### Discussion

Use this method to provide an accessibility label for a view that doesn’t display text, like an icon. For example, you could use this method to label a button that plays music with the text “Play”. Don’t include text in the label that repeats information that users already have. For example, don’t use the label “Play button” because a button already has a trait that identifies it as a button.
