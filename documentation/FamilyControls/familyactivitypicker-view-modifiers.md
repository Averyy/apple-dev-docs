# View Modifiers

**Framework**: FamilyControls

Apply standard modifiers to configure the family activity picker view and the views it contains.

#### Overview

Every type that conforms to the [`View`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/View) protocol gains access to the set of view modifiers defined by that protocol. For information about using view modifiers, see [`Configuring views`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/Configuring-Views).
