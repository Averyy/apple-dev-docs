## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated
func simultaneousGesture<T>(_ gesture: T, including mask: GestureMask = .all) -> some View where T : Gesture
```

#### Discussion

Use this method when you need to define and process  a view specific gesture simultaneously with the same priority as the view’s existing gestures. The example below defines a custom gesture that prints a message to the console and attaches it to the view’s `VStack`. Inside the `VStack` is a red heart `Image` defines its own `TapGesture` handler that also prints a message to the console and a blue rectangle with no custom gesture handlers.

Tapping or clicking the “heart” image sends two messages to the console: one for the image’s tap gesture handler, and the other from a custom gesture handler attached to the enclosing vertical stack. Tapping or clicking on the blue rectangle results only in the single message to the console from the tap recognizer attached to the `VStack`:

```swift
struct SimultaneousGestureExample: View {
    @State private var message = "Message"
    let newGesture = TapGesture().onEnded {
        print("Gesture on VStack.")
    }

    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing:25) {
            Image(systemName: "heart.fill")
                .resizable()
                .frame(width: 75, height: 75)
                .padding()
                .foregroundColor(.red)
                .onTapGesture {
                    print("Gesture on image.")
                }
            Rectangle()
                .fill(Color.blue)
        }
        .simultaneousGesture(newGesture)
        .frame(width: 200, height: 200)
        .border(Color.purple)
    }
}
```

## Parameters

- `gesture`: A gesture to attach to the view.
- `mask`: A value that controls how adding this gesture to the view   affects other gestures recognized by the view and its subviews.   Defaults to  .
