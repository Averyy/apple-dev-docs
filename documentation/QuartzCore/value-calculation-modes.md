# Value calculation modes

**Framework**: Core Animation

These constants are used by the [`calculationMode`](cakeyframeanimation/calculationmode.md) property.

## Topics

### Constants
- [static let linear: CAAnimationCalculationMode](caanimationcalculationmode/linear.md)
  Simple linear calculation between keyframe values.
- [static let discrete: CAAnimationCalculationMode](caanimationcalculationmode/discrete.md)
  Each keyframe value is used in turn, no interpolated values are calculated.
- [static let paced: CAAnimationCalculationMode](caanimationcalculationmode/paced.md)
  Linear keyframe values are interpolated to produce an even pace throughout the animation.
- [static let cubic: CAAnimationCalculationMode](caanimationcalculationmode/cubic.md)
  Smooth spline calculation between keyframe values.
- [static let cubicPaced: CAAnimationCalculationMode](caanimationcalculationmode/cubicpaced.md)
  Cubic keyframe values are interpolated to produce an even pace throughout the animation.
