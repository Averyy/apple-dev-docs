# Predefined Timing Functions

**Framework**: Core Animation

Constants that specify system-provided timing functions, used by [`init(name:)`](camediatimingfunction/init(name:).md).

## Topics

### Constants
- [static let linear: CAMediaTimingFunctionName](camediatimingfunctionname/linear.md)
  Linear pacing, which causes an animation to occur evenly over its duration.
- [static let easeIn: CAMediaTimingFunctionName](camediatimingfunctionname/easein.md)
  Ease-in pacing, which causes an animation to begin slowly and then speed up as it progresses.
- [static let easeOut: CAMediaTimingFunctionName](camediatimingfunctionname/easeout.md)
  Ease-out pacing, which causes an animation to begin quickly and then slow as it progresses.
- [static let easeInEaseOut: CAMediaTimingFunctionName](camediatimingfunctionname/easeineaseout.md)
  Ease-in-ease-out pacing, which causes an animation to begin slowly, accelerate through the middle of its duration, and then slow again before completing.
- [static let `default`: CAMediaTimingFunctionName](camediatimingfunctionname/default.md)
  The system default timing function. Use this function to ensure that the timing of your animations matches that of most system animations.
