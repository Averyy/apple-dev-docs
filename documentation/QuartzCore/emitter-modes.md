# Emitter Modes

**Framework**: Core Animation

These constants specify the possible emitter modes. They are used by the [`emitterMode`](caemitterlayer/emittermode.md) property.

## Topics

### Constants
- [static let points: CAEmitterLayerEmitterMode](caemitterlayeremittermode/points.md)
  Particles are emitted from points on the particle emitter.
- [static let outline: CAEmitterLayerEmitterMode](caemitterlayeremittermode/outline.md)
  Particles are emitted from the outline of the particle emitter.
- [static let surface: CAEmitterLayerEmitterMode](caemitterlayeremittermode/surface.md)
  Particles are emitted from the surface of the particle emitter.
- [static let volume: CAEmitterLayerEmitterMode](caemitterlayeremittermode/volume.md)
  Particles are emitted from the a position within the particle emitter.

## See Also

- [Emitter Shape](emitter-shape.md)
  The emission shape is a one, two or three dimensional shape that defines where the emitted particles originate. The shapes are defined by a subset of [`emitterPosition`](caemitterlayer/emitterposition.md), [`emitterZPosition`](caemitterlayer/emitterzposition.md), [`emitterSize`](caemitterlayer/emittersize.md) and [`emitterDepth`](caemitterlayer/emitterdepth.md) properties.
- [Emitter Render Order](emitter-render-order.md)
  These constants specify the order that emitter cells are composited. They are used by the [`renderMode`](caemitterlayer/rendermode.md) property.
