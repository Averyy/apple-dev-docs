## Declaration

```swift

```

#### Discussion

The value of this property must be in the range 0.0 to 1.0. The default value of this property is 0.0.

Combined with the [`strokeEnd`](cashapelayer/strokeend.md) property, this property defines the subregion of the path to stroke. The value in this property indicates the relative point along the path at which to begin stroking while the [`strokeEnd`](cashapelayer/strokeend.md) property defines the end point. A value of 0.0 represents the beginning of the path while a value of 1.0 represents the end of the path. Values in between are interpreted linearly along the path length.
