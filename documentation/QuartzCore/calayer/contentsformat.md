**Framework**: Core Animation  
**Kind**: property

A hint for the desired storage format of the layer contents.

**Availability**:

## Declaration

```swift
var contentsFormat: CALayerContentsFormat { get set }
```

#### Discussion

The default value of this property is [`RGBA8Uint`](calayercontentsformat/rgba8uint.md).

[`UIView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/UIKit/UIView) and layer-backed [`NSView`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSView) objects may change the value to a format appropriate for the current device.
