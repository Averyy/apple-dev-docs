# isGeometryFlipped

**Framework**: Core Animation  
**Kind**: property

A Boolean that indicates whether the geometry of the layer and its sublayers is flipped vertically.

## Declaration

```swift
var isGeometryFlipped: Bool { get set }
```

#### Discussion

If the layer is providing the backing for a layer-backed view, the view is responsible for managing the value in this property. For standalone layers, this property controls whether geometry values for the layer are interpreted using the standard or flipped coordinate system. The value of this property does not affect the rendering of the layer’s content.

The default value of this property is [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/false).
