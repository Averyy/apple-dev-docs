# setOpenTransportConnectionAsyncSelector(_:target:refCon:)

**Framework**: IOBluetooth  
**Kind**: method  
**Role**: Instance Method

Allows you to set the selector to be used when a transport connection is opened, or fails to open.

**Availability**:
- macOS

## Declaration

```swift
func setOpenTransportConnectionAsyncSelector(_ inSelector: Selector!, target inSelectorTarget: Any!, refCon inUserRefCon: UnsafeMutableRawPointer!)
```

```objc
- (void) setOpenTransportConnectionAsyncSelector:(SEL) inSelector target:(id) inSelectorTarget refCon:(void *) inUserRefCon;
```

## Discussion

You do not need to call this on the session typically, unless you have subclassed the OBEXSession to implement a new transport and that transport supports async opening of connections. If it does not support async open, then using this is pointless.

## Parameters

- `inSelector`: Selector to call on the target.
- `inSelectorTarget`: Target to be called with the selector.
- `inUserRefCon`: User’s refCon that will get passed to them when their selector is invoked.
