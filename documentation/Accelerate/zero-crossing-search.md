# Zero crossing search

**Framework**: Accelerate

Count and find the zero crossings in a vector.

## Topics

### Single-Vector Zero Crossing Search
- [static func countZeroCrossings<U>(U) -> UInt](vdsp/countzerocrossings(_:)-3vfmd.md)
  Returns the number of zero crossings in a double-precision vector.
- [static func countZeroCrossings<U>(U) -> UInt](vdsp/countzerocrossings(_:)-3btsl.md)
  Returns the number of zero crossings in a single-precision vector.
