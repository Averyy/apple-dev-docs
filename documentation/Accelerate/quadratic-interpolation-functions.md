# Quadratic interpolation functions

**Framework**: Accelerate

Compute the quadratic interpolation between the neighboring elements in a vector.

## Topics

### Vector-to-Vector Quadratic Interpolation
- [vDSP_vqint](vdsp_vqint.md)
  Calculates single-precision vector quadratic interpolation.
- [vDSP_vqintD](vdsp_vqintd.md)
  Calculates double-precision vector quadratic interpolation.

## See Also

- [Linear interpolation functions](linear-interpolation-functions.md)
  Compute the linear average between two vectors or between the neighboring elements in one vector.
