- [static var greater: BNNS.RelationalOperator](bnns/relationaloperator/greater.md)
  The operator that indicates the greater-than relationship.
- [static var greaterEqual: BNNS.RelationalOperator](bnns/relationaloperator/greaterequal.md)
  The operator that indicates the greater-than or equal-to relationship.
- [static var less: BNNS.RelationalOperator](bnns/relationaloperator/less.md)
  The operator that indicates the less-than relationship.
- [static var lessEqual: BNNS.RelationalOperator](bnns/relationaloperator/lessequal.md)
  The operator that indicates the less-than or equal-to relationship.
- [static var notEqual: BNNS.RelationalOperator](bnns/relationaloperator/notequal.md)
  The operator that indicates the not-equal relationship.
### Logical Operators
