# Multiplication

**Framework**: Accelerate

Multiply vectors that contain real or complex values.

## Topics

### Multiplying real matrices
- [vDSP_mmul](vdsp_mmul.md)
  Performs an out-of-place multiplication of two single-precision real matrices.
- [vDSP_mmulD](vdsp_mmuld.md)
  Performs an out-of-place multiplication of two double-precision real matrices.
### Multiplying complex matrices
- [vDSP_zmmul](vdsp_zmmul.md)
  Performs an out-of-place multiplication of two single-precision complex matrices.
- [vDSP_zmmulD](vdsp_zmmuld.md)
  Performs an out-of-place multiplication of two double-precision complex matrices.
### Multiplying and adding complex matrices
- [vDSP_zmma](vdsp_zmma.md)
  Adds a single-precision complex matrix to the product of two single-precision complex matrices.
- [vDSP_zmmaD](vdsp_zmmad.md)
  Adds a double-precision complex matrix to the product of two double-precision complex matrices.
### Multiplying and subtracting complex matrices
