# Normalization functions

**Framework**: Accelerate

Compute the mean and standard deviation of a vector and calculate new elements to have a zero mean and a unit standard deviation.

## Topics

### Normalization Functions
- [Finding the sharpest image in a sequence of captured images](finding-the-sharpest-image-in-a-sequence-of-captured-images.md)
  Share image data between vDSP and vImage to compute the sharpest image from a bracketed photo sequence.
