# Phase computation functions

**Framework**: Accelerate

Calculate the element-wise phase values, in radians, of a complex vector.

## Topics

### Single-Vector Phase Computation
- [static func phase<V>(DSPSplitComplex, result: inout V)](vdsp/phase(_:result:)-1ve4y.md)
  Calculates the single-precision element-wise phase values, in radians, of the supplied complex vector.
- [static func phase<V>(DSPDoubleSplitComplex, result: inout V)](vdsp/phase(_:result:)-56qb1.md)
  Calculates the double-precision element-wise phase values, in radians, of the supplied complex vector.
