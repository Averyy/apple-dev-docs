## Declaration

```swift
func la_vector_slice(_ vector: la_object_t, _ vector_first: la_index_t, _ vector_stride: la_index_t, _ slice_length: la_count_t) -> la_object_t
```

#### Return Value

A new vector with length slice_length whose elements are taken from vector.

#### Discussion

Create a slice of a vector.

The result object is the vector:

[ vector[vector_first], vector[vector_first+vector_stride], … … , vector[vector_first + (slice_length-1)*vector_stride] ]

Slices provide an efficient means to operate on subvectors and strides. These are lightweight objects that reference the storage of the vector from which they originate.  Creating a vector slice does not require any allocation beyond the object representing the slice, nor does it require copying.

This function supports slicing a vector, or a matrix that has only one row or only one column.  If the object is not a matrix or vector, or if it is a matrix with both dimensions larger than one, the returned object will have status LA_INVALID_PARAMETER_ERROR.

If the slice references indices that are less than zero or greater than or equal to the length of the vector, LA_SLICE_OUT_OF_BOUNDS_ERROR is returned.

Always return a vector with the same orientation as the input.  If input is vector_length x 1, output is vector_length x 1 and if input is 1 x vector_length, output is 1 x vector_length.

## Parameters

- `vector`: The vector to be sliced.
- `vector_first`: The index of the source vector element that will become the first element   of the new slice vector.
- `vector_stride`: The offset in the source vector between elements that will be consecutive in   the new slice vector.
- `slice_length`: The length of the resulting slice vector.
