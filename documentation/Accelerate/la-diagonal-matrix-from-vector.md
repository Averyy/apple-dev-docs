## Declaration

```swift
func la_diagonal_matrix_from_vector(_ vector: la_object_t, _ matrix_diagonal: la_index_t) -> la_object_t
```

#### Discussion

Create a matrix with a specified diagonal provided by a vector, and zeros in all the other entries.

Creates a new matrix with entries on the specified diagonal taken from the vector argument, and zeros in the other entries.  The matrix is square, and has size length(vector) + abs(matrix_diagonal).

If matrix_diagonal is zero, the main diagonal is set.  If matrix_diagonal is +1, the first superdiagonal is set.  If matrix_diagonal is -2, the second subdiagonal is set.

The diagonal may be specified by a vector or by a matrix that has only one row or only one column.  If the provided object is not a vector or matrix, or is a matrix with both dimensions larger than one, the returned object will have status LA_INVALID_PARAMETER_ERROR.

## Parameters

- `vector`: Vector providing the data for the non-zero diagonal.
- `matrix_diagonal`: The index of the non-zero diagonal.
