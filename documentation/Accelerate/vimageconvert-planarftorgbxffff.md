# vImageConvert_PlanarFToRGBXFFFF

**Framework**: Accelerate  
**Kind**: macro

Interleaves three 32-bit planar buffers into a floating-point 32-bit-per-channel, 4-channel interleaved RGBX buffer with the specified constant alpha value.

**Availability**:

- iPadOS ?+
- Mac Catalyst ?+

- tvOS ?+
- visionOS ?+
- watchOS ?+

## Declaration

```swift
#define vImageConvert_PlanarFToRGBXFFFF(_red, _green, _blue, _alpha, _dest, _flags)
```

#### Return Value

[`kvImageNoError`](kvimagenoerror.md); otherwise, one of the error codes in [`Data Types and Constants`](data-types-and-constants.md).

#### Discussion

This routine cannot be used in place.

## Parameters

- `_red`: The source vImage buffer that contains the red channel.
- `_green`: The source vImage buffer that contains the green channel.
- `_blue`: The source vImage buffer that contains the blue channel.
- `_alpha`: The constant destination alpha value.
- `_dest`: A pointer to the destination vImage buffer structure. You’re responsible for filling out the  ,  , and   fields of this structure, and for allocating a data buffer of the appropriate size. On return, the data buffer this structure points to contains the destination image data. When you no longer need the data buffer, deallocate the memory to prevent memory leaks.
- `_flags`: The options to use when performing the operation. If your code implements its own tiling or its own multithreading, pass  ; otherwise, pass  .
