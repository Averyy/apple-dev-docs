## Declaration

```swift
func BNNSArithmeticFilterApplyBatch(_ filter: BNNSFilter?, _ batch_size: Int, _ number_of_inputs: Int, _ in: UnsafeMutablePointer<UnsafeRawPointer>, _ in_stride: UnsafePointer<Int>, _ out: UnsafeMutableRawPointer, _ out_stride: Int) -> Int32
```

## Parameters

- `filter`: The filter to apply.
- `batch_size`: The number of input-output pairs.
- `number_of_inputs`: The number of inputs to the arithmetic operation.
- `in`: Pointer to the input data.
- `in_stride`: Increment, in values, between inputs.
- `out`: Pointer to the output data.
- `out_stride`: Increment, in values, between outputs.
