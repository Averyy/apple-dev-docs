# Single-precision floating-point matrices

**Framework**: Accelerate

Perform operations on matrices that contain single-precision floating-point elements.

#### Overview

A matrix is a 2D array of values arranged in rows and columns. The simd library provides support for matrices of up to four rows and four columns. It uses a column-major naming convention; for example, a [`simd_float4x2`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/simd/simd_float4x2) is a matrix that contains four columns and two rows.
