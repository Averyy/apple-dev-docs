## Declaration

```swift
static func divide<T, U, V>(_ vectorA: T, _ vectorB: U, result: inout V) where T : AccelerateBuffer, U : AccelerateBuffer, V : AccelerateMutableBuffer, T.Element == Double, U.Element == Double, V.Element == Double
```

#### Discussion

This function calculates the division of the first `N` elements of input vectors `A` and `B`, and writes the result to output vector `C`, as follows:

```swift
 for (n = 0; n < N; ++n)
    C[n] = A[n] / B[n];
```

The middle row represents the operation as three boxes with division signs. The bottom row represents the output vector C as three boxes. The diagram has connecting lines from the input vectors to the operation, and from the operation to the output vectors.](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/images/com.apple.accelerate/media-4336921@2x.png)

The following code shows an example of using this function:

```swift
    let count = 5
    
    let a: [Double] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
    let b: [Double] = [ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5]
    
    let c = [Double](unsafeUninitializedCapacity: count) {
        buffer, initializedCount in
        
        vDSP.divide(a, b,
                    result: &buffer)
        
        initializedCount = count
    }
    
    // Prints "[10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0]".
    print(c)
```

## Parameters

- `vectorA`: The first input vector, `A`.
- `vectorB`: The second input vector, `B`.
- `result`: The output vector, `C`.
