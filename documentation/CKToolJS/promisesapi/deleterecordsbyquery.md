# deleteRecordsByQuery

**Framework**: CKTool JS  
**Kind**: method

Deletes records matching the provided query.

**Availability**:
- CKTool JS 1.2.15+

## Declaration

```swift
CancellablePromise deleteRecordsByQuery(
	DeleteRecordsByQueryParams params
);
```

#### Return Value

A `CancellablePromise` with the following resolutions.

#### Discussion

If the promise is successful, it will resolve with one of the following dictionaries:

- `{ statusCode: 200; result: CKDBPagedBatchDeleteResponse }`

The promise may reject and throw the following:

- `DocumentedResponseError`, if the HTTP status code is 421. The result member will be a dictionary conforming to AuthenticationRequiredError.
- `DocumentedResponseError`, if the HTTP status code is none of the above and in the range 400 to 599. The result member will be a dictionary conforming to RequestError.
- `ValidationError`, if the parameters to the method are incorrect.
- A `FetchError` descendant, if there is a problem with the network request. A reference to the request object can be used to examine the underlying cause.

#### Discussion

The `params` dictionary has the following properties:

```javascript
dictionary DeleteRecordsByQueryParams {
  CKDBDeleteRecordsByQueryRequestBody body;
  string containerId;
  CKEnvironment environment;
  string databaseType;
  string zoneName;
}
```

- `body`: Query and other options for the delete records operation.
- `containerId`: The container identifier. See `Container`.
- `environment`: The container environment. For valid values, see `CKEnvironment`.
- `databaseType`: The database type. For valid values, see `CKDatabaseType`.
- `zoneName`: The zone name. See `CKDBZone`.

This operation allows you to delete multiple records of a record type that match specific filters. If the operation completes, the response contains a `CKDBPagedBatchDeleteResponse` object that details the result of the batch delete operation. You can delete up to 200 records in a single operation. If more records match your filters, the response also contains a continuation token that you can use to delete the next set of matching records.

## Parameters

- `params`: A dictionary as described in the Discussion section.
