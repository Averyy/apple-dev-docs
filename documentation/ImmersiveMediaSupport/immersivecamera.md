# ImmersiveCamera

**Framework**: Immersive Media Support  
**Kind**: struct

A structure that holds the required information for an immersive media camera to process and render video frames.

**Availability**:
- macOS 26.0+
- visionOS 26.0+

## Declaration

```swift
struct ImmersiveCamera
```

#### Overview

This type holds information including the camera identifier, type, default presentation rate, pose, and calibration data. Immersive media content can be captured with more than one camera calibrated lens, which means it’s necessary to use different geometry for each to render the corresponding video clips. AIV content creators should be able to add or remove any camera at any point during the creation and iteration process.
