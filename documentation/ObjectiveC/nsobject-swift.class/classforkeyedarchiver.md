# classForKeyedArchiver

**Framework**: Objective-C Runtime  
**Kind**: property  
**Role**: Instance Property

Subclasses to substitute a new class for instances during keyed archiving.

## Declaration

```swift
var classForKeyedArchiver: AnyClass? { get }
```

```objc
@property (readonly, nullable) Class classForKeyedArchiver;
```

#### Discussion

The object will be encoded as if it were a member of the class. This property is overridden by the encoder class and instance name to class encoding tables. If this property is `nil`, the result of this property is ignored.
