## Declaration

```swift
func performSelector(inBackground aSelector: Selector, with arg: Any?)
```

#### Discussion

This method creates a new thread in your application, putting your application into multithreaded mode if it was not already. The method represented by `aSelector` must set up the thread environment just as you would for any other new thread in your program. For more information about how to configure and run threads, see [`Threading Programming Guide`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Multithreading/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000057i).

## Parameters

- `aSelector`: A   that identifies the method to invoke. The method should not have a significant return value and should take a single argument of type id, or no arguments.
- `arg`: The argument to pass to the method when it is invoked. Pass   if the method does not take an argument.
