## Declaration

```swift
func replacementObject(for archiver: NSArchiver) -> Any?
```

#### Return Value

The object to substitute for the receiver during archiving.

#### Discussion

This method is invoked by `NSArchiver`. `NSObject`’s implementation returns the object returned by [`replacementObject(for:)`](nsobject-swift.class/replacementobject(for:)-2l8ox.md).

## Parameters

- `archiver`: The archiver creating an archive.
