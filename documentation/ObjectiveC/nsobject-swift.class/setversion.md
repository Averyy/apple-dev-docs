# setVersion(_:)

**Framework**: Objective-C Runtime  
**Kind**: method

Sets the receiver’s version number.

**Availability**:
- iOS ?+
- iPadOS ?+
- Mac Catalyst ?+
- macOS ?+
- tvOS ?+
- visionOS ?+
- watchOS ?+

## Declaration

```swift
class func setVersion(_ aVersion: Int)
```

#### Discussion

The version number is helpful when instances of the class are to be archived and reused later. The default version is `0`.

##### Special Considerations

The version number applies to `NSArchiver`/`NSUnarchiver`, but not to `NSKeyedArchiver`/`NSKeyedUnarchiver`.  A keyed archiver does not encode class version numbers.

## Parameters

- `aVersion`: The version number for the receiver.
