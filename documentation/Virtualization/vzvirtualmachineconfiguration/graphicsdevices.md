# graphicsDevices

**Framework**: Virtualization  
**Kind**: property  
**Role**: Instance Property

The list of graphics devices.

**Availability**:
- macOS 12.0+

## Declaration

```swift
var graphicsDevices: [VZGraphicsDeviceConfiguration] { get set }
```

```objc
@property (copy) NSArray<VZGraphicsDeviceConfiguration *> * graphicsDevices;
```

## Discussion

The default value of this property is an empty array. If your VM exposes one or more graphics devices, assign an array of [`VZGraphicsDeviceConfiguration`](../vzgraphicsdeviceconfiguration.md) objects to this property.
