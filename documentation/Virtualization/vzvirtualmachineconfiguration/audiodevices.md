# audioDevices

**Framework**: Virtualization  
**Kind**: property  
**Role**: Instance Property

The list of audio devices.

**Availability**:
- macOS 12.0+

## Declaration

```swift
var audioDevices: [VZAudioDeviceConfiguration] { get set }
```

```objc
@property (copy, readwrite) NSArray<VZAudioDeviceConfiguration *> * audioDevices;
```

## Discussion

The default value of this property is an empty array. If your VM exposes one or more audio devices, assign an array of [`VZAudioDeviceConfiguration`](../vzaudiodeviceconfiguration.md) objects to this property.
