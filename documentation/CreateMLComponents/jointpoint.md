struct JointPoint
```

## Topics

### Creating a joint point
- [init(JointKey, location: CGPoint, confidence: Float)](jointpoint/init(_:location:confidence:).md)
  Creates a joint point with its key, location and confidence.
### Getting the detection confidence
- [var confidence: Float](jointpoint/confidence.md)
  A detection confidence of the joint
### Getting the key name
- [let key: JointKey](jointpoint/key.md)
  The key name for the joint
### Getting the joint location
- [var location: CGPoint](jointpoint/location.md)
  The location of the joint point
### Default Implementations
