### Instance Methods
- [func allSatisfy((Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool](audiofeatureprint/featuresequence/allsatisfy(_:).md)
  Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether all elements produced by the asynchronous sequence satisfy the given predicate.
- [func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) async throws -> ElementOfResult?) -> AsyncThrowingCompactMapSequence<Self, ElementOfResult>](audiofeatureprint/featuresequence/compactmap(_:)-3x5cj.md)
  Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps an error-throwing closure over the base sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.
- [func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) async -> ElementOfResult?) -> AsyncCompactMapSequence<Self, ElementOfResult>](audiofeatureprint/featuresequence/compactmap(_:)-3xg7l.md)
  Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.
- [func contains(Self.Element) async rethrows -> Bool](audiofeatureprint/featuresequence/contains(_:).md)
  Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the asynchronous sequence contains the given element.
- [func contains(where: (Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool](audiofeatureprint/featuresequence/contains(where:).md)
  Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the asynchronous sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.
- [func drop(while: (Self.Element) async -> Bool) -> AsyncDropWhileSequence<Self>](audiofeatureprint/featuresequence/drop(while:).md)
  Omits elements from the base asynchronous sequence until a given closure returns false, after which it passes through all remaining elements.
- [func dropFirst(Int) -> AsyncDropFirstSequence<Self>](audiofeatureprint/featuresequence/dropfirst(_:).md)
  Omits a specified number of elements from the base asynchronous sequence, then passes through all remaining elements.
- [func filter((Self.Element) async -> Bool) -> AsyncFilterSequence<Self>](audiofeatureprint/featuresequence/filter(_:).md)
  Creates an asynchronous sequence that contains, in order, the elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.
- [func first(where: (Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Self.Element?](audiofeatureprint/featuresequence/first(where:).md)
  Returns the first element of the sequence that satisfies the given predicate.
- [func flatMap<SegmentOfResult>((Self.Element) async -> SegmentOfResult) -> AsyncFlatMapSequence<Self, SegmentOfResult>](audiofeatureprint/featuresequence/flatmap(_:)-2btzh.md)

- [func map<Transformed>((Self.Element) async -> Transformed) -> AsyncMapSequence<Self, Transformed>](audiofeatureprint/featuresequence/map(_:)-1vvbe.md)
  Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.
- [func map<Transformed>((Self.Element) async throws -> Transformed) -> AsyncThrowingMapSequence<Self, Transformed>](audiofeatureprint/featuresequence/map(_:)-6orgs.md)
  Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given error-throwing closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.
- [func max(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Self.Element?](audiofeatureprint/featuresequence/max(by:).md)
  Returns the maximum element in the asynchronous sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.

  Returns an asynchronous sequence, containing the initial, consecutive elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.
- [func reduce<Result>(Result, (Result, Self.Element) async throws -> Result) async rethrows -> Result](audiofeatureprint/featuresequence/reduce(_:_:).md)
  Returns the result of combining the elements of the asynchronous sequence using the given closure.
- [func reduce<Result>(into: Result, (inout Result, Self.Element) async throws -> Void) async rethrows -> Result](audiofeatureprint/featuresequence/reduce(into:_:).md)
  Returns the result of combining the elements of the asynchronous sequence using the given closure, given a mutable initial value.
