## Topics

### Creating the reader
- [init()](videoreader/init.md)
  Creates a video reader.
### Reading
- [static read(_:)](videoreader/read(_:).md)
  Reads a sequence of annotated files as an array of annotated async sequences of video frames.
- [static func readCamera(configuration: VideoReader.CameraConfiguration) async throws -> VideoReader.CameraAsyncBuffers](videoreader/readcamera(configuration:).md)
  Reads an async sequence of video frames captured with a video camera.
- [static func read(contentsOf: URL) async throws -> VideoReader.AsyncFrames](videoreader/read(contentsof:).md)
  Reads a video file as an async sequence of video frames.
- [VideoReader.AsyncFrames](videoreader/asyncframes.md)
  An async sequence of video frames.
- [VideoReader.CameraAsyncBuffers](videoreader/cameraasyncbuffers.md)
  An async sequence of video frames.
- [VideoReader.CameraConfiguration](videoreader/cameraconfiguration.md)
  The configuration of the camera to pass to the `readCamera` method.
### Applying
- [func applied(to: URL, eventHandler: EventHandler?) async throws -> VideoReader.AsyncFrames](videoreader/applied(to:eventhandler:).md)
  Reads a video file as an async sequence of video frames.
