# Tile Effect Filters

**Framework**: Core Image

Produce tiled images from source images.

## Topics

### Filters
- [class func affineClamp() -> any CIFilter & CIAffineClamp](cifilter/3228265-affineclamp.md)
  Performs a transform on the image and extends the image edges to infinity.
- [class func affineTile() -> any CIFilter & CIAffineTile](cifilter/3228266-affinetile.md)
  Performs a transform on the image and tiles the result.
- [class func eightfoldReflectedTile() -> any CIFilter & CIEightfoldReflectedTile](cifilter/3228322-eightfoldreflectedtile.md)
  Creates an eight-way reflected pattern.
- [class func fourfoldReflectedTile() -> any CIFilter & CIFourfoldReflectedTile](cifilter/3228327-fourfoldreflectedtile.md)
  Creates a four-way reflected pattern.
- [class func fourfoldRotatedTile() -> any CIFilter & CIFourfoldRotatedTile](cifilter/3228328-fourfoldrotatedtile.md)
  Creates a tiled image by rotating a tile in increments of 90 degrees.
- [class func fourfoldTranslatedTile() -> any CIFilter & CIFourfoldTranslatedTile](cifilter/3228329-fourfoldtranslatedtile.md)
  Creates a tiled image by applying four translation operations.
- [class func glideReflectedTile() -> any CIFilter & CIGlideReflectedTile](cifilter/3228333-glidereflectedtile.md)
  Tiles an image by rotating and reflecting a tile from the image.
- [class func kaleidoscope() -> any CIFilter & CIKaleidoscope](cifilter/3228343-kaleidoscope.md)
  Creates a 12-way kaleidoscopic image from an image.
- [class func opTile() -> any CIFilter & CIOpTile](cifilter/3228373-optile.md)
  Produces an effect that mimics a style of visual art that uses optical illusions.
- [class func parallelogramTile() -> any CIFilter & CIParallelogramTile](cifilter/3228379-parallelogramtile.md)
  Warps the image to create a parallelogram and tiles the result.
- [class func perspectiveTile() -> any CIFilter & CIPerspectiveTile](cifilter/3228381-perspectivetile.md)
  Tiles an image by adjusting the perspective of the image.
- [class func sixfoldReflectedTile() -> any CIFilter & CISixfoldReflectedTile](cifilter/3228405-sixfoldreflectedtile.md)
  Produces a tiled image from a source image by applying a six-way reflected symmetry.
- [class func sixfoldRotatedTile() -> any CIFilter & CISixfoldRotatedTile](cifilter/3228406-sixfoldrotatedtile.md)
  Creates a tiled image by rotating in increments of 60 degrees.
- [class func triangleKaleidoscope() -> any CIFilter & CITriangleKaleidoscope](cifilter/3228425-trianglekaleidoscope.md)
  Create a triangular kaleidoscope effect and then tiles the result.
- [class func triangleTile() -> any CIFilter & CITriangleTile](cifilter/3228426-triangletile.md)
  Tiles a triangular area of an image.
- [class func twelvefoldReflectedTile() -> any CIFilter & CITwelvefoldReflectedTile](cifilter/3228427-twelvefoldreflectedtile.md)
  Creates a tiled image by rotating in increments of 30 degrees.
