## Declaration

```swift
class func glassDistortion() -> any CIFilter & CIGlassDistortion
```

#### Return_value

The distorted image.

#### Discussion

This method applies the glass distortion filter to an image. This effect distorts an image by applying a glass texture from the raised portions of the texture map image.

The glass distortion filter uses the following properties:

The following code creates a filter that results in a glass-like distortion applied to the image:

```swift
func glassDistortion(inputImage: CIImage, textureImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let filter = CIFilter.glassDistortion()
    filter.inputImage = inputImage
    filter.textureImage = textureImage
    filter.center = CGPoint(x: 1791, y: 1344)
    filter.scale = 500
    return filter.outputImage!
}
```

The right image shows the result of applying the glass distortion filter. It appears as though the image is behind a piece of privacy glass.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/888ecc1c11/rendered2x-1709303625.png)
