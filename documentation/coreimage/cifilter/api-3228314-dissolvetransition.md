## Declaration

```swift
class func dissolveTransition() -> any CIFilter & CIDissolveTransition
```

#### Return_value

The transition image.

#### Discussion

This method applies the disintegrate transition filter to an image. The effect transitions from one image to another by using a fade effect.

The dissolve transition filter uses the following properties:

The following code creates a filter that produces a fade transition from the input image and the target image:

```swift
func dissolve(inputImage: CIImage, targetImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let dissolveTransition = CIFilter.dissolveTransition()
    dissolveTransition.inputImage = inputImage
    dissolveTransition.targetImage = targetImage
    dissolveTransition.time = 0.5
    return dissolveTransition.outputImage!
}
```

In the photograph on the right is a tall building with two trees directly in front of the building. In the center photo, a dissolve with mask transition filter is applied, resulting in a still photograph of the moving transition. The left photograph is overlaid on the right photo while slowly transitioning to the city image, with a slow fade of the flower image to the city image.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/5ab02518d7/rendered2x-1591037451.png)
