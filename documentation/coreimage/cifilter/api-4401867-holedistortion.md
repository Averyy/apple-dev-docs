# holeDistortion()

**Framework**: Core Image  
**Kind**: clm

## Declaration

```swift
class func holeDistortion() -> any CIFilter & CIHoleDistortion
```

#### Return_value

The distorted image.

#### Discussion

This method applies the hole distortion filter to an image. This effect distorts the image by generating a circular area that displaces pixels in the image by pushing them outward from the hole defined by the radius.

The absolute threshold filter uses the following properties:

The following code creates a filter that results in an image becoming distorted from the center outward:

```swift
func holeDistortion(inputImage: CIImage) -> CIImage {
    let filter = CIFilter.holeDistortion()
    filter.inputImage = inputImage
    filter.radius = 300
    filter.center = CGPoint(x: 1791, y: 1344)
    return filter.outputImage!
}
```

![Two images next to each other. The image on the left contains a black-and-white checkerboard pattern. The image on the right has the hole distortion filter applied. The center of the image has been replaced by a black circle and the pixels have been pushed out of place and stretched to make room for this.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/b3a676ea93/rendered2x-1707385028.png)
