# Halftone Effect Filters

**Framework**: Core Image

Simulate monochrome and CMYK halftone screens.

## Topics

### Filters
- [class func circularScreen() -> any CIFilter & CICircularScreen](cifilter-swift.class/circularscreen.md)
  Adds a circular overlay to an image.
- [class func cmykHalftone() -> any CIFilter & CICMYKHalftone](cifilter-swift.class/cmykhalftone.md)
  Adds a series of colorful dots to an image.
- [class func dotScreen() -> any CIFilter & CIDotScreen](cifilter-swift.class/dotscreen.md)
  Creates a monochrome image with a series of dots to add detail.
- [class func hatchedScreen() -> any CIFilter & CIHatchedScreen](cifilter-swift.class/hatchedscreen.md)
  Creates a monochrome image with a series of lines to add detail.
- [class func lineScreen() -> any CIFilter & CILineScreen](cifilter-swift.class/linescreen.md)
  Creates a monochrome image with a series of small lines to add detail.
