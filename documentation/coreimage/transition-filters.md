# Transition Filters

**Framework**: Core Image

Transition between two images by using effects including page curl and swipe.

## Topics

### Filters
- [class func accordionFoldTransition() -> any CIFilter & CIAccordionFoldTransition](cifilter-swift.class/accordionfoldtransition.md)
  Transitions by folding and crossfading an image to reveal the target image.
- [class func barsSwipeTransition() -> any CIFilter & CIBarsSwipeTransition](cifilter-swift.class/barsswipetransition.md)
  Transitions between two images by removing rectangular portions of an image.
- [class func copyMachineTransition() -> any CIFilter & CICopyMachineTransition](cifilter-swift.class/copymachinetransition.md)
  Simulates the effect of a copy machine scanner light to transiton between two images.
- [class func disintegrateWithMaskTransition() -> any CIFilter & CIDisintegrateWithMaskTransition](cifilter-swift.class/disintegratewithmasktransition.md)
  Transitions between two images using a mask image.
- [class func dissolveTransition() -> any CIFilter & CIDissolveTransition](cifilter-swift.class/dissolvetransition.md)
  Transitions between two images with a fade effect.
- [class func flashTransition() -> any CIFilter & CIFlashTransition](cifilter-swift.class/flashtransition.md)
  Creates a flash of light to transition between two images.
- [class func modTransition() -> any CIFilter & CIModTransition](cifilter-swift.class/modtransition.md)
  Transitions between two images by applying irregularly shaped holes.
- [class func pageCurlTransition() -> any CIFilter & CIPageCurlTransition](cifilter-swift.class/pagecurltransition.md)
  Simulates the curl of a page, revealing the target image.
- [class func pageCurlWithShadowTransition() -> any CIFilter & CIPageCurlWithShadowTransition](cifilter-swift.class/pagecurlwithshadowtransition.md)
  Simulates the curl of a page, revealing the target image with added shadow.
- [class func rippleTransition() -> any CIFilter & CIRippleTransition](cifilter-swift.class/rippletransition.md)
  Simulates a ripple in a pond to transiton from one image to another.
- [class func swipeTransition() -> any CIFilter & CISwipeTransition](cifilter-swift.class/swipetransition.md)
  Gradually transitions from one image to another with a swiping motion.
