# Distortion Filters

**Framework**: Core Image

Apply distortion to images.

## Topics

### Filters

- [class func glassLozenge() -> any CIFilter & CIGlassLozenge](cifilter/4401866-glasslozenge.md)
  Creates a lozenge-shaped lens and distorts the image.
- [class func holeDistortion() -> any CIFilter & CIHoleDistortion](cifilter/4401867-holedistortion.md)

  Distorts an image by generating a light tunnel.
- [class func ninePartStretched() -> any CIFilter & CINinePartStretched](cifilter/4401871-ninepartstretched.md)
  Distorts an image by stretching it between two breakpoints.
- [class func ninePartTiled() -> any CIFilter & CINinePartTiled](cifilter/4401872-nineparttiled.md)
  Distorts an image by tiling portions of it.
- [class func pinchDistortion() -> any CIFilter & CIPinchDistortion](cifilter/4401874-pinchdistortion.md)
  Distorts an image by creating a pinch effect with stronger distortion in the center.
- [class func stretchCrop() -> any CIFilter & CIStretchCrop](cifilter/4401877-stretchcrop.md)
  Distorts an image by stretching or cropping to fit a specified size.
- [class func torusLensDistortion() -> any CIFilter & CITorusLensDistortion](cifilter/4401879-toruslensdistortion.md)
  Creates a torus-shaped lens to distort the image.
- [class func twirlDistortion() -> any CIFilter & CITwirlDistortion](cifilter/4401880-twirldistortion.md)
  Distorts an image by rotating pixels around a center point.
- [class func vortexDistortion() -> any CIFilter & CIVortexDistortion](cifilter/4401882-vortexdistortion.md)
  Distorts an image by using a vortex effect created by rotating pixels around a point.
