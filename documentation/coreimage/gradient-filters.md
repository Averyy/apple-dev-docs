# Gradient Filters

**Framework**: Core Image

Generate linear and radial gradients.

## Topics

### Filters
- [class func gaussianGradient() -> any CIFilter & CIGaussianGradient](cifilter/3228332-gaussiangradient.md)
  Generates a gradient that varies from one color to another using a Gaussian distribution.
- [class func hueSaturationValueGradient() -> any CIFilter & CIHueSaturationValueGradient](cifilter/3228342-huesaturationvaluegradient.md)
  Generates a gradient representing a specified color space.
- [class func linearGradient() -> any CIFilter & CILinearGradient](cifilter/3228351-lineargradient.md)
  Generates a color gradient that varies along a linear axis between two defined endpoints.
- [class func radialGradient() -> any CIFilter & CIRadialGradient](cifilter/3228395-radialgradient.md)
  Generates a gradient that varies radially between two circles having the same center.
- [class func smoothLinearGradient() -> any CIFilter & CISmoothLinearGradient](cifilter/3228407-smoothlineargradient.md)
  Generates a gradient that blends colors along a linear axis between two defined endpoints.
