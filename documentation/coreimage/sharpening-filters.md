# Sharpening Filters

**Framework**: Core Image

Apply sharpening to images.

## Topics

### Filters
- [class func sharpenLuminance() -> any CIFilter & CISharpenLuminance](cifilter-swift.class/sharpenluminance.md)
  Applies a sharpening effect to an image.
- [class func unsharpMask() -> any CIFilter & CIUnsharpMask](cifilter-swift.class/unsharpmask.md)
  Increases an image’s contrast between two colors.
### Protocols
- [protocol CISharpenLuminance](cisharpenluminance.md)
  The properties you use to configure a sharpen luminance filter.
- [protocol CIUnsharpMask](ciunsharpmask.md)
  The properties you use to configure an unsharp mask filter.
