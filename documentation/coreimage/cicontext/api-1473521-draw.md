## Declaration

```swift
func draw(_ image: CIImage, at atPoint: CGPoint, from fromRect: CGRect)
```

#### Discussion

This method because it is ambiguous as to the units of the dimensions and won’t work as expected in a high-resolution environment which is why you should use `drawImage:inRect:fromRect:` instead. 

On iOS platforms, this method draws the image onto a render buffer for the OpenGL ES context. Use this method only if the [`CIContext`](cicontext.md) object is created with `contextWithEAGLContext:`, and hence, you are rendering to a CAEAGLLayer.

## Parameters

- `im`: A Core Image image object.
- `p`: The point in the context destination to draw to.
- `src`: The region of the image to draw.
