# unpremultiplyingAlpha()

**Framework**: Core Image  
**Kind**: instm

Returns a new image created by dividing the image’s RGB values by its alpha values.

**Availability**:
- iOS 10.0+
- iPadOS 10.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- macOS 10.12+
- tvOS 10.0+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
func unpremultiplyingAlpha() -> CIImage
```

#### Return_value

An image object representing the result of the operation.

#### Discussion

Premultiplied alpha speeds up the rendering of images, but some custom filter routines can be expressed more efficiently with non-premultiplied RGB values. Use this method if you need to apply such a filter to an image that has premultiplied alpha.
