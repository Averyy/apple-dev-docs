# applyingFilter(_:parameters:)

**Framework**: Core Image  
**Kind**: method

Returns a new image created by applying a filter to the original image with the specified name and parameters.

**Availability**:
- iOS 8.0+
- iPadOS 8.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- macOS 10.10+
- tvOS ?+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
func applyingFilter(_ filterName: String, parameters params: [String : Any]) -> CIImage
```

#### Return Value

An image object representing the result of applying the filter.

#### Discussion

Calling this method is equivalent to the following sequence of steps:

1. Creating a [`CIFilter`](cifilter-swift.class.md) instance
2. Setting the original image as the filter’s `inputImage` parameter
3. Setting the remaining filter parameters from the `params` dictionary
4. Retrieving the [`outputImage`](cifilter-swift.class/outputimage.md) object from the filter

> ❗ **Important**:  This method, though convenient, is inefficient if used multiple times in succession.  Achieve better performance by chaining filters without asking for the outputs of individual filters.

## Parameters

- `filterName`: The name of the filter to apply, as used when creating a   instance with the   method.
- `params`: A dictionary whose key-value pairs are set as input values to the filter. Each key is a constant that specifies the name of an input parameter for the filter, and the corresponding value is the value for that parameter. See   for built-in filters and their allowed parameters.
