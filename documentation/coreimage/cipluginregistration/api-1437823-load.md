# load(_:)

**Framework**: Core Image  
**Kind**: intfm  
**Required**: Yes

Loads and initializes an image unit, performing custom tasks as needed.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.4+

## Declaration

```swift
func load(_ host: UnsafeMutableRawPointer!) -> Bool
```

#### Return_value

Returns `true` if the image unit is successfully initialized

#### Discussion

 The `load` method is called once by the host to initialize the image unit when the first filter in the image unit is instantiated. The method provides the image unit with an opportunity to perform custom initialization, such as a registration check. 

## Parameters

- `host`: Reserved for future use.
