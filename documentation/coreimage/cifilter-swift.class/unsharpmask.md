#### Discussion

This method applies the unsharp mask filter to an image. The effect increases the contrast of the edge between pixels of different colors within the defined radius property.

The unsharp mask filter uses the following properties:

The following code creates a filter that results in the objects within the image becoming darker:

```swift
func unsharp (inputImage: CIImage) -> CIImage? {    
    let unsharpMask = CIFilter.unsharpMask()
    unsharpMask.inputImage = inputImage
    unsharpMask.radius = 5
    unsharpMask.intensity = 2.5
    return unsharpMask.outputImage!
}
```
