# renderedTime

**Framework**: LivePhotosKit JS  
**Kind**: property

The current timestamp, as a floating-point number of seconds from the beginning of the animation, that is truly displayed on the screen.

**Availability**:
- LivePhotosKit JS 1.3+

## Declaration

```swift
readonly attribute Number renderedTime;
```

#### Discussion

If [`currentTime`](livephotoskit.player/currenttime.md) is set to a value for which the required video frames are not yet available, `renderedTime` remains at its current value until the video frames are acquired. At that point, the Player is re-rendered, and `renderedTime` is updated to once again reflect [`currentTime`](livephotoskit.player/currenttime.md).
