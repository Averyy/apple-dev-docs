The Matte node determines its output using the alpha channels of the foreground and background inputs. The RGB component of the output is `Ff+B(1-f)` and the alpha component of the output is `f+b(1-f)`. Below is a simple node graph that uses the In node to blend a wood and rock texture.

Below are the two original images, the image representation of the alpha of the foreground, and the resulting blended texture applied to a cube.
