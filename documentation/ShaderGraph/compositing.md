# Compositing

**Framework**: ShaderGraph  
**Kind**: dictionary

Generate a single output from the combination of multiple data values.

#### Overview

The compositing process takes multiple input values and combines them in varying proportions to create a single output. You can use Compositing nodes to combine textures and achieve a specific appearance. For example, you might show a background texture only in places where the foreground texture is transparent. Compositing nodes support the combination of colors, but also other data types, such as vectors and floating-point numbers.

## Topics

### Nodes
- [Premultiply](compositing/premultiply.md)
  Multiplies the RGB channels of the input by the alpha channel.
- [Unpremultiply](compositing/unpremultiply.md)
  Divides the RGB channels of the input by the alpha channel.
- [Additive Mix](compositing/additive-mix.md)
  Adds foreground and background values.
- [Subtractive Mix](compositing/subtractive-mix.md)
  Subtracts foreground from background values.
- [Difference](compositing/difference.md)
  Outputs the distance between foreground and background values.
- [Burn](compositing/burn.md)
  A blend operation that darkens the foreground layer using the background.
- [Dodge](compositing/dodge.md)
  A blend operation that lightens the background layer depending on the foreground.
- [Screen](compositing/screen.md)
  A blend operation that lightens areas that are darker than white.
- [Overlay](compositing/overlay.md)
  A blend operation that multiplies dark areas and screens light areas.
- [Disjoint Over](compositing/disjoint-over.md)
  A merge operation that layers foreground over background color, but assumes no overlap in partially transparent areas covered by both.
- [In](compositing/in.md)
  Outputs areas of foreground that overlap with the alpha of background.
- [Mask](compositing/mask.md)
  Outputs areas of background that overlap with the alpha of foreground.
- [Matte](compositing/matte.md)
  A merge operation that layers premultiplied foreground over background.
- [Out](compositing/out.md)
  Outputs areas of foreground that do not overlap with background.
- [Over](compositing/over.md)
  A merge operation that layers foreground over background, using the alpha of the foreground.
- [Inside](compositing/inside.md)
  Multiplies a mask to all channels of the input.
- [Outside](compositing/outside.md)
  Multiplies (1 - mask) to all channels of the input.
- [Mix](compositing/mix.md)
  Mixes foreground and background inputs, weighting based on mix value.
