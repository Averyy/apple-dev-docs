# Luminance

**Framework**: ShaderGraph  
**Kind**: subscript

Outputs a grayscale value containing the luminance of the incoming RGB color in all color channels.

#### Parameter Types

#### Parameter Descriptions

#### Discussion

The Luminance node takes in a color input and outputs that input as a grayscale image. The node computes the grayscale of an image by taking the dot product of the luma coefficients and the color vector. Below is an example of a simple node graph that uses the luminance node to convert an image to grayscale.
