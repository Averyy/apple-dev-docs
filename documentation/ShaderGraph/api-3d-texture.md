# 3D-Texture

**Framework**: ShaderGraph  
**Kind**: dictionary

Project multiple 2D images onto a surface to create a 3D texture.

## Topics

### Nodes
- [Triplanar Projection](3d-texture/triplanar-projection.md)
  Samples data from three images and projects each along its respective coordinate axis and blends them by geometric normal.
