# label

**Framework**: Watchkit  
**Kind**: property

A succinct label that succinctly identifies the purpose of the image region.

**Availability**:
- watchOS 2.0+

## Declaration

```swift
var label: String { get set }
```

#### Discussion

The label should be a very short, localized string that identifies the purpose of the region, but does not necessarily convey the imagery displayed in that region.
