## Declaration

```swift
func firstIndex(of element: Self.Element) -> Self.Index?
```

#### Return Value

The first index where `element` is found. If `element` is not found in the collection, returns `nil`.

#### Discussion

After using `firstIndex(of:)` to find the position of a particular element in a collection, you can use it to access the element by subscripting. This example shows how you can modify one of the names in an array of students.

```None
var students = ["Ben", "Ivy", "Jordell", "Maxime"]
if let i = students.firstIndex(of: "Maxime") {
    students[i] = "Max"
}
print(students)
// Prints "["Ben", "Ivy", "Jordell", "Max"]"
```

> **Note**: O(), where  is the length of the collection.

## Parameters

- `element`: An element to search for in the collection.
