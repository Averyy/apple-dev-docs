# texture

**Framework**: Compute Graph  
**Kind**: namespace

A set of nodes for the texture stage that sample and generate texture data.

**Availability**:
- macOS ?+

## Topics

### Functions
- [uint2 texture::position()](texture/position.md)
  Current pixel’s position
- [void texture::setPixel(value)](texture/setpixel.md)
  In the context of a texture stage, sets the current pixels’ value.
- [float2 texture::uv()](texture/uv.md)
  Current pixel’s position, in UV [0.0, 1.0] coordinates.
