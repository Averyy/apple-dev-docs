###### Resolved Issues

- The verification of the query parameters in `queryDyskineticSymptomFromDate` was improved such that if the specified end time is beyond the current time, the `queryDyskineticSymptomFromDate` will return once it reaches the current time. The updated version number of the API is 1.0.1. (102915648)
