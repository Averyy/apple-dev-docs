# ResponsePagination

**Framework**: Apple Ads Platform API  
**Kind**: dictionary

Pagination metadata returned in list responses from Recommendations and Suggestions endpoints.

**Availability**:
- apple-ads-platform-api 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
object RecommendationResponsePagination
```

#### Discussion

`ResponsePagination` is the pagination state object returned in Recommendations and Suggestions list responses.

To page through results, increment the `offset` in subsequent requests by the `pageSize` until `offset + pageSize >= totalCount`. Unlike cursor-based pagination, offset-based pagination allows jumping to any page directly, though new recommendations may appear or disappear between requests.

##### Example

```json
{
  "offset": 0,
  "pageSize": 20,
  "totalCount": 47
}
```

## Properties

- `offset` (int32): The starting position of the current page. Read-only.
- `pageSize` (int32): The number of items returned in this page. Read-only.
- `totalCount` (int64): The total number of items matching the query across all pages. Read-only.
