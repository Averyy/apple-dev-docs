**Framework**: RealityKit  
**Kind**: property

The total playback time of the animation.

## Declaration

```swift
var duration: TimeInterval { get set }
```

#### Discussion

The framework sets a value for this property depending on the underlying animation data and the specified [`speed`](animationview/speed.md).

You can override the default duration by defining [`trimStart`](fromtobyanimation/trimstart.md), [`trimEnd`](fromtobyanimation/trimend.md), or [`trimDuration`](fromtobyanimation/trimduration.md).
