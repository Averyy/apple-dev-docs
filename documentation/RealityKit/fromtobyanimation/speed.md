# speed

**Framework**: RealityKit  
**Kind**: property

A factor that increases or decreases the animation’s rate of playback.

**Availability**:
- iOS 15.0+
- iPadOS 15.0+
- Mac Catalyst 15.0+
- macOS 12.0+
- visionOS ?+

## Declaration

```swift
var speed: Float { get set }
```

#### Discussion

The default value is `1.0`, which doesn’t alter the animation’s duration. A value of `2.0` indicates that the duration is half the normal rate. A value of `0.5` indicates that the duration is twice the normal rate. Negative values play the animation in reverse.

This property doesn’t affect the animation’s [`delay`](fromtobyanimation/delay.md).
