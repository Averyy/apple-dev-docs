- [func map<T, E>((Self.Element) throws(E) -> T) throws(E) -> [T]](physicsjoints/map(_:)-1t6f9.md)
  Returns an array containing the results of mapping the given closure over the sequence’s elements.
- [func max(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?](physicsjoints/max(by:).md)
  Returns the maximum element in the sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
- [func min(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?](physicsjoints/min(by:).md)
  Returns the minimum element in the sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.

- [func sorted<S, Comparator>(using: S) -> [Self.Element]](physicsjoints/sorted(using:)-758g5.md)
  Returns the elements of the sequence, sorted using the given array of `SortComparator`s to compare elements.
- [func starts<PossiblePrefix>(with: PossiblePrefix, by: (Self.Element, PossiblePrefix.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool](physicsjoints/starts(with:by:).md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are equivalent to the elements in another sequence, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.
- [func withContiguousStorageIfAvailable<R>((UnsafeBufferPointer<Self.Element>) throws -> R) rethrows -> R?](physicsjoints/withcontiguousstorageifavailable(_:).md)
