## Declaration

```swift
final func replace(using commandBuffer: any MTLCommandBuffer) -> any MTLBuffer

The buffer’s contents are in an uninitialized state.

The caller supplies the MTLCommandBuffer that they intend to use for buffer modifications. RealityKit will wait for the MTLCommandBuffer to complete before utilizing the buffer for rendering.
