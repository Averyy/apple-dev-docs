# Creating a spatial drawing app with RealityKit

**Framework**: RealityKit

Use low-level mesh and texture APIs to achieve fast updates to a person’s brush strokes by integrating RealityKit with ARKit and SwiftUI.

**Availability**:
- visionOS 2.0+
- Xcode 16.0+

#### Overview

> **Note**: This sample code project is associated with WWDC24 session 10104: [`Build a spatial drawing app with RealityKit`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/10104/).

##### Configure the Sample Code Project

To run this sample code, you’ll need:

- An Apple Vision Pro with visionOS 2 or later
- Xcode 16 or later

Because this sample app uses ARKit hand tracking on visionOS, drawing features aren’t available in the visionOS simulator.
