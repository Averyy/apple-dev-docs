# Scanning objects using Object Capture

**Framework**: RealityKit

Implement a full scanning workflow for capturing objects on iOS devices.

**Availability**:
- iOS 18.0+
- iPadOS 18.0+
- Xcode 16.0+

#### Overview

> **Note**: This sample code project is associated with WWDC24 session 10107: [`Discover area mode for Object Capture`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/10107/) and WWDC23 session 10191: [`Meet Object Capture for iOS`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10191/).

You need to run this sample code project on a physical device. It does not compile for Simulator.

##### Configure the Sample Code Project

To run this sample app, you need an iPhone or iPad with the following:

- A LiDAR Scanner
- An A14 Bionic chip or later
- iOS or iPadOS 18 or later
