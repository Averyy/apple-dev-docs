## Declaration

```swift
mutating func partition(by belongsInSecondPartition: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Index
```

#### Return Value

The index of the first element in the reordered collection that matches `belongsInSecondPartition`. If no elements in the collection match `belongsInSecondPartition`, the returned index is equal to the collection’s `endIndex`.

#### Discussion

After partitioning a collection, there is a pivot index `p` where no element before `p` satisfies the `belongsInSecondPartition` predicate and every element at or after `p` satisfies `belongsInSecondPartition`. This operation isn’t guaranteed to be stable, so the relative ordering of elements within the partitions might change.

In the following example, an array of numbers is partitioned by a predicate that matches elements greater than 30.

```None
var numbers = [30, 40, 20, 30, 30, 60, 10]
let p = numbers.partition(by: { $0 > 30 })
// p == 5
// numbers == [30, 10, 20, 30, 30, 60, 40]
```

The `numbers` array is now arranged in two partitions. The first partition, `numbers[..<p]`, is made up of the elements that are not greater than 30. The second partition, `numbers[p...]`, is made up of the elements that  greater than 30.

```None
let first = numbers[..<p]
// first == [30, 10, 20, 30, 30]
let second = numbers[p...]
// second == [60, 40]
```

Note that the order of elements in both partitions changed. That is, `40` appears before `60` in the original collection, but, after calling `partition(by:)`, `60` appears before `40`.

> **Note**: O(), where  is the length of the collection.

O(), where  is the length of the collection.

## Parameters

- `belongsInSecondPartition`: A predicate used to partition   the collection. All elements satisfying this predicate are ordered   after all elements not satisfying it.
