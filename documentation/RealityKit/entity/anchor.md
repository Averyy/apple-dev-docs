## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
@preconcurrency var anchor: (any HasAnchoring)? { get }
```

#### Discussion

This property returns `nil` if no ancestor can act as an anchor. An entity can act as an anchor if it adopts the [`HasAnchoring`](hasanchoring.md) protocol. Just because an ancestor can be anchored doesn’t mean that it is. Inspect the [`isAnchored`](entity/isanchored.md) property to see if an entity (or one of its ancestors) is anchored.
