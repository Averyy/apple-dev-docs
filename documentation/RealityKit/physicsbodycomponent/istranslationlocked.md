# isTranslationLocked

**Framework**: RealityKit  
**Kind**: property

A tuple of Boolean values that you use to lock the position of the physics body along any of the three axes.

**Availability**:
- iOS 13.0+
- iPadOS 13.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.0+
- macOS 10.15+
- visionOS ?+

## Declaration

```swift
var isTranslationLocked: (x: Bool, y: Bool, z: Bool)
```

#### Discussion

You can restrict movement of the body along one or more axes by setting the corresponding item in the tuple to `true`. For example, if you set the `x` and the `z` items in the tuple to `true`, then the body can move only along the y-axis. By default, movement isn’t restricted.
