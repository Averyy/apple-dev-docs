# Rendering a windowed game in stereo

**Framework**: RealityKit

Bring an iOS or iPadOS game to visionOS and enhance it.

**Availability**:
- visionOS 2.0+
- Xcode 16.0+

#### Overview

This sample shows how to render a Metal app in a window on visionOS, with stereoscopy, head tracking, [`Rendering at different rasterization rates`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Metal/rendering-at-different-rasterization-rates), and a 3D frame around the window. The starting app is the [`Rendering a scene with deferred lighting in Swift`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Metal/rendering-a-scene-with-deferred-lighting-in-swift) for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.

> **Note**: This sample code project is associated with WWDC24 session 10093: [`Bring your iOS or iPadOS game to visionOS`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/10093/).

##### Configure the Sample Code Project
