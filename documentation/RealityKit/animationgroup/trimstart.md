## Declaration

```swift
var trimStart: TimeInterval? { get set }
```

#### Discussion

This property is `nil` by default, which plays the animation with `time` = `0`. If you set a value, the animation edits the duration according to the specified beginning time.

If you set a negative value for this property, the duration increases and the additional animation data fills in based on the [`fillMode`](animationview/fillmode.md) you choose.
