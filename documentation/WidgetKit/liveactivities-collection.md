# Live Activities

**Framework**: WidgetKit

Let people track updates from your app with Live Activities.

#### Overview

Live Activities display up-to-date content from your app, such as event and task information on the Lock Screen or in the Dynamic Island. Additionally, Live Activities appear in CarPlay and on a paired Apple Watch or Mac. To create Live Activities, you use WidgetKit together with [`ActivityKit`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ActivityKit).
