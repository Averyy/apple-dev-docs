**Framework**: Apple Pencil

Enhance your iPad app’s user experience by supporting drawing, handwriting, and other features of Apple Pencil.

#### Overview

Apple Pencil is an input accessory for iPad that people rely on for tasks like drawing, sketching, painting, jotting notes, marking up documents, and more. In addition to drawing and handwriting, Apple Pencil can also serve as a pointer and UI interaction tool.
