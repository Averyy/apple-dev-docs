# Core experiences

**Framework**: Technology Overviews

Embrace features that improve people’s experience with your app on Apple devices.

A great experience keeps people engaged with your app. A good design for your app’s interface is one way to engage people, but Apple platforms include features to enhance the usability of your content, and extend your app’s reach to other parts of the system. During the design process, incorporate the features that make sense into your plans.

#### Convenience

Convenience is about making your app’s content available when people need it most, and on all their devices. Adopt features that help people access your app quickly and get directly to the content they want. Send that content where it’s needed most, including to one of their other devices.

#### Information

Give people the information they need, and help them access it quickly. Make content available from your app and from other parts of the system, such as the [`Home Screen, Lock Screen, or Today view`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://support.apple.com/en-us/118610). Integrate new types of information that are difficult to produce and manage on your own, such as maps or weather information.

#### Communication and Connection

Communicate information in a timely and appropriate manner to improve people’s engagement with your app. Generate notifications to people informed of events that require their attention. Make it easier for people to connect with their friends and family through your app.

#### App Extensions

Extend your app’s reach into other parts of the system using app extensions. Although you ship app extensions as part of your app, the system runs them as separate processes. Identify the types of app extensions you need, and learn how to share information between an app extension and your app.
