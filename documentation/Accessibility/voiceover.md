#### Overview

VoiceOver is an assistive technology that enables people to experience the interface on their devices without having to see the screen. People who are blind or have low vision depend on VoiceOver to provide auditory feedback while using their devices, but VoiceOver can be useful to people in a wide variety of contexts. For example, someone prone to motion sickness might choose to turn VoiceOver on while they’re in a moving vehicle.
