#### Overview

Switch Control is an assistive technology that lets people control their iOS devices using a single switch or multiple switches. With Switch Control, people can use switches to perform actions like selecting, tapping, dragging and dropping, typing, and freehand drawing. A person uses a switch to select an item or location on the screen, then uses the switch to choose an action.
