# Speech

**Framework**: Accessibility

A person may have a speech disability or prefer to connect without using their voice.

#### Overview

People who are unable to speak, have a speech disability, or prefer to communicate through text can use Apple’s speech accessibility features to communicate through their Apple devices. Design and develop your app to support speech accessibility features and provide a great experience for people who rely on these features.
