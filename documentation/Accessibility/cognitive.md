# Cognitive

**Framework**: Accessibility

A person may have difficulty remembering a sequence of steps, or they may find an overly complex user interface difficult to process and manage.

#### Overview

People who have cognitive impairments or challenges with maintaining focus can use Apple’s cognitive accessibility features to stay focused, streamline tasks, or limit the number of decisions to make. Design and develop your app to support cognitive accessibility features and provide a great experience for people who rely on these features.
