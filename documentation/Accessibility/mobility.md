# Mobility

**Framework**: Accessibility

A person with reduced mobility may have difficulty holding a device or tapping the interface.

#### Overview

People with physical impairments or limited mobility can use Apple’s mobility accessibility features to modify their touch interactions, create custom gestures, and control their devices in the ways that work best for them. Design and develop your app to support mobility accessibility features and provide a great experience for people who rely on these features.
