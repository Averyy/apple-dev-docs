# Vision

**Framework**: Accessibility

A person may be blind or color blind, or have a vision challenge that makes focusing difficult.

#### Overview

People who are blind, have low vision, or prefer larger text can use Apple’s vision accessibility features to customize their displays, control their devices, and navigate their surroundings. Design and develop your app to support vision accessibility features and provide a great experience for people who rely on these features.
