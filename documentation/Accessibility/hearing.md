# Hearing

**Framework**: Accessibility

A person may be deaf, have partial hearing loss, or have difficulty hearing sounds within a certain range.

#### Overview

People who are who are deaf or hard of hearing can use Apple’s hearing accessibility features to use hearing devices, enhance the sounds they hear, and filter out extraneous noises. Design and develop your app to support hearing accessibility features and provide a great experience for people who rely on these features.
