# Accessibility Inspector

**Framework**: Accessibility

Reveal how your app represents itself to people using accessibility features.

#### Overview

Use Accessibility Inspector to display, query, and test accessibility information for the elements in your app’s view hierarchy. Audit your app to confirm that it addresses accessibility issues such as clipped text and unlabeled elements, and uses appropriate text size and color contrast levels. The information provided by the inspector supplements accessibility testing by providing some of the raw information you need to debug accessibility issues.

To use Accessibility Inspector, open Xcode and choose Xcode > Open Developer Tool > Accessibility Inspector.
