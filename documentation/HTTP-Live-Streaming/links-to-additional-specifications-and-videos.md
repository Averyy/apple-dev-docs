**Framework**: HTTP Live Streaming

Review additional specifications and documents.

#### Overview

The following links are in addition to the specifications listed below.

- [`RFC 8216`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8216).  The IETF Informational specfication for HTTP Live Streaming.  This document describes the HTTP Live Streaming protocol as of August 2017.  This document specifies the data format of the files and the actions to be taken by the server and the clients of the streams.
- [`FairPlay Streaming`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/streaming/fps/). A technology describing how to secure the delivery of streaming media to devices through the HTTP Live Streaming protocol. Using FairPlay Streaming (FPS) technology, content providers, encoding vendors, and delivery networks can encrypt content, securely exchange keys, and protect playback on iOS, tvOS, and Safari on macOS.
- [`MPEG-2 Stream Encryption Format for HTTP Live Streaming`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/HLS_Sample_Encryption/Intro/Intro.html). This document describes a sample-level encryption format for several types of elementary streams that can be carried in MPEG-2 transport streams ISO/IEC 13818-1 and MPEG elementary audio streams.
- [`Timed Metadata for HTTP Live Streaming`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/HTTP_Live_Streaming_Metadata_Spec/Introduction/Introduction.html). This document describes how ID3 metadata is carried as timed metadata in MPEG-2 Transport Streams as used by the HTTP Live Streaming protocol.
- [`Providing JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) chapters`](providing-javascript-object-notation-json-chapters.md). This document describes how to provide chapter markers and other per-chapter metadata used by iOS, tvOS, and macOS for HTTP Live Streaming (HLS).
- [`Carriage of ID3 Timed Metadata in the Common Media Application Format (CMAF)`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://aomediacodec.github.io/id3-emsg/). This document defines how ID3 metadata are carried as timed metadata in Common Media Application Format (CMAF) compatible fragmented MP4 streams using Event Message boxes.
