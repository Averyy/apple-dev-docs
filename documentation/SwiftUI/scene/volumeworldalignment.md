# volumeWorldAlignment(_:)

**Framework**: SwiftUI  
**Kind**: method

Specifies how a volume should be aligned when moved in the world.

**Availability**:
- visionOS 2.0+

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated
func volumeWorldAlignment(_ behavior: WorldAlignmentBehavior) -> some Scene
```

#### Discussion

For example, you can create a volume that remains parallel to the floor even when lifted up high above eye level by applying a [`gravityAligned`](worldalignmentbehavior/gravityaligned.md) alignment to the scene:

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        .windowStyle(.volumetric)
        .volumeWorldAlignment(.gravityAligned)
    }
}
```

The default value if you don’t apply the modifier is [`automatic`](worldalignmentbehavior/automatic.md). With that strategy, volumes will tilt themselves so the front remains fully visible while being repositioned.
