#### Discussion

Notably, the section’s content is a `SubviewsCollection`, not a `Subview`, as it can be made up of multiple subviews. That means in most cases, the subviews collection should be treated as a collection (either indexed into, or used with a `ForEach`), or the subviews collection should be wrapped in a container view, like a layout, or other custom container:

```swift
PinboardSectionsLayout {
    ForEach(sections: content) { section in
        VStack {
            section.content
        }
    }
}
```

Here, we want to create one view for `PinboardSectionsLayout` to place per section in content. To do that, we surround the `ForEach` body in another container, a `VStack` layout, ensuring the different subviews of section.content are treated as a single view by the surrounding layout.
