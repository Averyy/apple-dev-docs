# Performance analysis

**Framework**: SwiftUI

Measure and improve your app’s responsiveness.

#### Overview

Use Instruments to detect hangs and hitches in your app, and to analyze long view body updates and frequently occurring SwiftUI updates that can contribute to hangs and hitches.

## Topics

### Essentials
- [Understanding user interface responsiveness](../Xcode/understanding-user-interface-responsiveness.md)
  Make your app more responsive by examining the event-handling and rendering loop.
- [Understanding hangs in your app](../Xcode/understanding-hangs-in-your-app.md)
  Determine the cause for delays in user interactions by examining the main thread and the main run loop.
- [Understanding hitches in your app](../Xcode/understanding-hitches-in-your-app.md)
  Determine the cause of interruptions in motion by examining the render loop.
### Analyzing SwiftUI performance
- [Understanding and improving SwiftUI performance](../Xcode/understanding-and-improving-swiftui-performance.md)
  Identify and address long-running view updates, and reduce the frequency of updates.
