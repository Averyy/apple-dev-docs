#### Discussion

On iOS, the inset grouped list style displays a continuous background color that extends from the section header, around both sides of list items in the section, and down to the section footer. This visually groups the items to a greater degree than either the [`inset`](liststyle/inset.md) or [`grouped`](liststyle/grouped.md) styles do.
