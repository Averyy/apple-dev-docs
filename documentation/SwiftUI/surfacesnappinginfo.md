# SurfaceSnappingInfo

**Framework**: SwiftUI  
**Kind**: struct

A type representing information about the window scenes snap state.

**Availability**:
- visionOS 26.0+

## Declaration

```swift
struct SurfaceSnappingInfo
```

#### Overview

Use the provided [`SurfaceSnappingInfo`](surfacesnappinginfo.md) to modify the contents of your view.

```swift
struct LightFixtureView: View {
    @Environment(\.surfaceSnappingInfo)
    var snappingInfo: SurfaceSnappingInfo

    var body: some View {
        if snappingInfo.isSnapped {
            switch SurfaceSnappingInfo.authorizationStatus {
                case .authorized:
                    switch snappingInfo.classification {
                        case .table:
                            LampView()
                        case .floor:
                            FloorLampView()
                        default:
                            DefaultLampView()
                    }
                default:
                    DefaultLampView()
            }
        } else {
            FloatingOrbLampView()
        }
    }
}
```

The bottom of volumes may snap to horizontal surfaces and the back of windows may snap to vertical surfaces.

## Topics

### Instance Properties
- [var classification: SurfaceClassification?](surfacesnappinginfo/classification.md)
  A type that provides information about the surface classification the scene is snapped to. This property only has a value if the scene is snapped and `authorizationStatus` is `.authorized`.
- [var isSnapped: Bool](surfacesnappinginfo/issnapped.md)
  A value that represents whether the scene is currently snapped to a physical surface or not.
### Type Properties
- [static var authorizationStatus: SurfaceSnappingInfo.AuthorizationStatus](surfacesnappinginfo/authorizationstatus-swift.type.property.md)
  A value that represents whether the user has authorized providing more detailed information about the surface scenes are snapped to. To request this detailed surface information, in your `Info.plist` file, set `UIWantsDetailedSurfaceInfo` to `YES` and set `NSWorldSensingUsageDescription` to provide a description of why your app is requesting this information.
### Enumerations
- [SurfaceSnappingInfo.AuthorizationStatus](surfacesnappinginfo/authorizationstatus-swift.enum.md)
  A type representing whether the user has granted permissions to provide more detailed information about the surface a scene is snapped to.
