# Building rich SwiftUI text experiences

**Framework**: SwiftUI

Build an editor for formatted text using SwiftUI text editor views and attributed strings.

**Availability**:
- iOS 26.0+
- iPadOS 26.0+
- Xcode 26.0+

#### Overview

> **Note**: This sample code project is associated with WWDC25 session 280: [`Code-along: Cook up a rich text experience in SwiftUI with AttributedString`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/280/).

You can follow along with the code written in the WWDC25 session, learning how to upgrade `TextEditor` to rich text, build custom controls, and constrain the formatting options the editor provides.

After the code-along, you can learn more about how to persist rich text using SwiftData, and how to export rich text documents using the `Transferable` protocol.

##### Configure the Sample Code Project

To configure the sample code project, do the following in Xcode:

1. Open the sample with the latest version of Xcode.
2. Set the developer team to let Xcode automatically manage the provisioning profile.
