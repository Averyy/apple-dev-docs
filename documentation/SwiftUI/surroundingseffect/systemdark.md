An effect that dims passthrough video.

#### Discussion

Use this value with the [`preferredSurroundingsEffect(_:)`](view/preferredsurroundingseffect(_:).md) view modifier when you want to dim passthrough video while displaying a particular view. Doing so helps to draw attention to your app’s content while still enabling people to remain aware of their surroundings.
