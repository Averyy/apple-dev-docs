**Framework**: SwiftUI  
**Kind**: method

Scales this shape without changing its bounding frame.

## Declaration

```swift
func scale(x: CGFloat = 1, y: CGFloat = 1, anchor: UnitPoint = .center) -> ScaledShape<Self>
```

#### Return Value

A scaled form of this shape.

#### Discussion

Both the `x` and `y` multiplication factors halve their respective dimension’s size when set to `0.5`, maintain their existing size when set to `1`, double their size when set to `2`, and so forth.

## Parameters

- `x`: The multiplication factor used to resize this shape along its   x-axis.
- `y`: The multiplication factor used to resize this shape along its   y-axis.

## See Also

- [func trim(from: CGFloat, to: CGFloat) -> some Shape](shape/trim(from:to:).md)
  Trims this shape by a fractional amount based on its representation as a path.
- [func transform(CGAffineTransform) -> TransformedShape<Self>](shape/transform(_:).md)
  Applies an affine transform to this shape.
- [func size(CGSize) -> some Shape](shape/size(_:).md)
  Returns a new version of self representing the same shape, but that will ask it to create its path from a rect of `size`. This does not affect the layout properties of any views created from the shape (e.g. by filling it).
- [func size(width: CGFloat, height: CGFloat) -> some Shape](shape/size(width:height:).md)
  Returns a new version of self representing the same shape, but that will ask it to create its path from a rect of size `(width, height)`. This does not affect the layout properties of any views created from the shape (e.g. by filling it).
- [func scale(CGFloat, anchor: UnitPoint) -> ScaledShape<Self>](shape/scale(_:anchor:).md)
  Scales this shape without changing its bounding frame.
- [func rotation(Angle, anchor: UnitPoint) -> RotatedShape<Self>](shape/rotation(_:anchor:).md)
  Rotates this shape around an anchor point at the angle you specify.
- [func offset(_:)](shape/offset(_:).md)
  Changes the relative position of this shape using the specified point.
- [func offset(x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat) -> OffsetShape<Self>](shape/offset(x:y:).md)
  Changes the relative position of this shape using the specified point.
