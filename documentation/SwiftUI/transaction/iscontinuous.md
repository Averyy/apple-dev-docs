**Framework**: SwiftUI  
**Kind**: property  
**Role**: Instance Property

A Boolean value that indicates whether the transaction originated from an action that produces a sequence of values.

## Declaration

```swift
var isContinuous: Bool { get set }
```

## Discussion

This value is `true` if a continuous action created the transaction, and is `false` otherwise. Continuous actions include things like dragging a slider or pressing and holding a stepper, as opposed to tapping a button.
