# onInAppPurchaseCompletion(perform:)

**Framework**: SwiftUI  
**Kind**: method

Add an action to perform when a purchase initiated from a StoreKit view within this view completes.

**Availability**:
- iOS 17.0+
- iPadOS 17.0+
- macOS 14.0+
- tvOS 17.0+
- visionOS 1.0+
- watchOS 10.0+

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated
func onInAppPurchaseCompletion(perform action: ((Product, Result<Product.PurchaseResult, any Error>) async -> ())?) -> some View
```

#### Discussion

By default, transactions from successful in-app store view purchases will be emitted from `Transaction.updates`. If the purchase fails with an error, an alert will be displayed. You can revert a view back to this behavior by providing `nil` for action.

Only one action will be performed for each purchase. Descendant views can override the action by using another [`onInAppPurchaseCompletion(perform:)`](view/oninapppurchasecompletion(perform:).md) modifier.

## Parameters

- `action`: The action to perform, with the product value and the purchase result   provided as parameters.
