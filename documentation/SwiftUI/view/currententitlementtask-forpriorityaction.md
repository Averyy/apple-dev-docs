# currentEntitlementTask(for:priority:action:)

**Framework**: SwiftUI  
**Kind**: method

Declares the view as dependent on the entitlement of an In-App Purchase product, and returns a modified view.

**Availability**:
- iOS 17.0+
- iPadOS 17.0+
- macOS 14.0+
- tvOS 17.0+
- visionOS 1.0+
- watchOS 10.0+

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated
func currentEntitlementTask(for productID: String, priority: TaskPriority = .medium, action: @escaping (EntitlementTaskState<VerificationResult<Transaction>?>) async -> ()) -> some View
```

#### Discussion

Before a view modified with this method appears, a task will start in the background to get the current entitlement. While the view is presented, the task will call `action` whenever the entitlement changes or the task’s state changes.

Consumable in-app purchases will always pass `nil` to `action`. For auto-renewable subscriptions, use `subscriptionStatusTask(for:priority:action:)` to get the full status information for the subscription.

## Parameters

- `productID`: The product ID to get the entitlement for. The task restarts whenever this   parameter changes.
- `priority`: The task priority to use when creating the task.
- `action`: The action to perform when the task’s state changes.
