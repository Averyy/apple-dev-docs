# onVolumeViewpointChange(updateStrategy:initial:_:)

**Framework**: SwiftUI  
**Kind**: method

Adds an action to perform when the viewpoint of the volume changes.

**Availability**:
- visionOS 2.0+

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
@preconcurrency func onVolumeViewpointChange(updateStrategy: VolumeViewpointUpdateStrategy = .supported, initial: Bool = true, _ action: @escaping (Viewpoint3D, Viewpoint3D) -> Void) -> some View
```

#### Discussion

Use the provided [`Viewpoint3D`](viewpoint3d.md) to update the content of the volume:

```swift
struct RobotContentView: View {
    @State var robotRotation: Rotation3D = .identity

    var body: some View {
        Model3D(named: "robot")
            .onVolumeViewpointChange { _, newValue in
                robotRotation = Rotation3D.slerp(
                    from: robotRotation,
                    to: newValue.squareAzimuth.orientation,
                    t: 1.0,
                    along: .shortest
                )
            }
            .rotation3DEffect(robotRotation)
            .animation(.easeInOut, value: robotRotation)
    }
}
```

By default, the action will only be run when the new viewpoint is equivalent to one of the values provided through [`supportedVolumeViewpoints(_:)`](view/supportedvolumeviewpoints(_:).md). The viewpoint will be equivalent to where the window bar and ornaments are presented for a volume. Providing `.all` for the `updateStrategy` argument will result in the action being called without regard to the supported viewpoints.

To determine if the volume is being viewed from an unsupported viewpoint, provide `.all` for the `updateStrategy` argument and check if the viewpoint is not within the supported viewpoints:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var showingMoveToFrontSign = false
    @State var moveToFrontSignViewpoint: Viewpoint3D = .standard

    let supportedViewpoints = [SquareAzimuth.front]

    var body: some View {
        MoveToFrontSignView(viewpoint: moveToFrontSignViewpoint)
            .opacity(showingMoveToFrontSign ? 1.0 : 0.0)
            .animation(.easeInOut, value: showingMoveToFrontSign)
            .onVolumeViewpointChange(updateStrategy: .all)
                { _, newValue in

                moveToFrontSignViewpoint = newViewpoint

                let isSupported = supportedViewpoints.contains(
                    newViewpoint.squareAzimuth)
                showingMoveToFrontSign = !isSupported
            }
            .supportedVolumeViewpoints(supportedViewpoints)
    }
}
```

The old and new [`Viewpoint3D`](viewpoint3d.md) provided to the action are relative to the center of the volume.

Reading this value is only valid inside a [`View`](view.md) that inherits the environment of a [`Scene`](scene.md) created with a [`VolumetricWindowStyle`](volumetricwindowstyle.md). This value will be equivalent to [`standard`](viewpoint3d/standard.md) when read within a standard window.

## Parameters

- `updateStrategy`: Whether the action should be run for all viewpoint   changes or only for supported viewpoint changes.
- `initial`: Whether the action should be run when this view initially   appears.
- `action`: A closure to run when the viewpoint changes. The closure is   also run when the volume is first opened.
