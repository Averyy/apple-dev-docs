# windowFullScreenBehavior(_:)

**Framework**: SwiftUI  
**Kind**: method

Configures the full screen functionality for the window enclosing `self`.

**Availability**:
- macOS 15.0+

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated
func windowFullScreenBehavior(_ behavior: WindowInteractionBehavior) -> some View
```

#### Discussion

By default, the window full screen functionality is determined by the scene, as well as any modifiers applied to it. Additionally, when using the [`windowResizability(_:)`](scene/windowresizability(_:).md) modifier, the maximum size of the window’s contents will also determine whether a window can be made full screen.

You can use this modifier to override the default behavior.

For example, you can specify that a window cannot enter full screen mode:

```swift
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .windowFullScreenBehavior(.disabled)
        }
    }
}
```

## Parameters

- `behavior`: The full screen behavior.
