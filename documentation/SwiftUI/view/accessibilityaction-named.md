func accessibilityAction(named name: Text, _ handler: @escaping () -> Void) -> ModifiedContent<Self, AccessibilityAttachmentModifier>
```

#### Discussion

For example, this is how a custom action to compose a new email could be added to a view.

```swift
var body: some View {
    ContentView()
        .accessibilityAction(named: Text("New Message")) {
            // Handle action
        }
}
```
