# textInputSuggestions(_:id:content:)

**Framework**: SwiftUI  
**Kind**: method

Configures the text input suggestions for this view.

**Availability**:
- macOS 15.0+

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated
func textInputSuggestions<Data, ID, Content>(_ data: Data, id: KeyPath<Data.Element, ID>, @ViewBuilder content: @escaping (Data.Element) -> Content) -> some View where Data : RandomAccessCollection, ID : Hashable, Content : View
```

#### Discussion

You can suggest text completions during a text input operation by providing data to this modifier. The interface presents the suggestion views as a list of choices when someone activates the text editing interface.

Associate a string with each suggestion view by adding the [`textInputCompletion(_:)`](view/textinputcompletion(_:).md) modifier to the view.

Use `Label` to get platform-standard visual representations of suggestion text accompanied with images, and `Section` for labelled sections of results.

## Parameters

- `data`: The data that is used to create views dynamically.
- `id`: The key path to the provided data’s identifier.
- `content`: The view builder that creates views dynamically.
