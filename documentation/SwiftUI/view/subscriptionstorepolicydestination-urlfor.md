- macOS 14.0+
- visionOS 1.0+
- watchOS 10.0+

## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated
func subscriptionStorePolicyDestination(url: URL, for button: SubscriptionStorePolicyKind) -> some View
```

#### Discussion

You can also set a view as the destination using [`subscriptionStorePolicyDestination(for:destination:)`](view/subscriptionstorepolicydestination(for:destination:).md). If you do not set a destination, or pass `nil` for `url`, the system will use the automatic behavior. Check the documentation for the value you provide for `button` to understand the automatic behavior.

By default, the subscription store shows the terms of service & privacy policy buttons if you set a destination for at least one policy. The policy that is not explicitly set will use the automatic behavior. You can override this behavior using the [`storeButton(_:for:)`](view/storebutton(_:for:).md) modifier, with [`policies`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/StoreKit/StoreButtonKind/policies) as the second parameter.

## Parameters

- `url`: The URL of the web page to open when someone chooses to view the policy.
- `button`: The policy button to associate the URL with.
