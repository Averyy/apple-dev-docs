func privacySensitive(_ sensitive: Bool = true) -> some View
```

#### Discussion

SwiftUI redacts views marked with this modifier when you apply the [`privacy`](redactionreasons/privacy.md) redaction reason.

```swift
struct BankAccountView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Account #")

            Text(accountNumber)
                .font(.headline)
                .privacySensitive() // Hide only the account number.
        }
    }
}
```
