## Declaration

```swift
nonisolated
func onDrag<V>(_ data: @escaping () -> NSItemProvider, @ViewBuilder preview: () -> V) -> some View where V : View
```

#### Return Value

A view that activates this view as the source of a drag-and- drop operation, beginning with user gesture input.

#### Discussion

Applying the `onDrag(_:preview:)` modifier adds the appropriate gestures for drag and drop to this view. When a drag operation begins, a rendering of `preview` is generated and used as the preview image.

To customize the lift preview, shown while the system transitions to show your custom `preview`, apply a [`contentShape(_:_:eoFill:)`](view/contentshape(_:_:eofill:).md) with a [`dragPreview`](contentshapekinds/dragpreview.md) kind. For example, you can change the preview’s corner radius or use a nested view as the preview.

## Parameters

- `data`: A closure that returns a single     that represents the draggable data from this view.
- `preview`: A   to use as the source for the dragging   preview, once the drag operation has begun. The preview is centered over   the source view.
