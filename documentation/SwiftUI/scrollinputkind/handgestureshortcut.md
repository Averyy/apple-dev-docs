# handGestureShortcut

**Framework**: SwiftUI  
**Kind**: property

A finger or wrist movement that the user can perform in order to scroll a view.

**Availability**:
- watchOS 11.0+

## Declaration

```swift
static let handGestureShortcut: ScrollInputKind
```

#### Discussion

On watchOS, double-tapping the thumb and index finger together will scroll a view when no on-screen control has been designated the primary action for that hand gesture shortcut.
