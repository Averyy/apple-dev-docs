# Creatives

**Framework**: Apple Ads

Create and manage ad creatives within your organization.

#### Overview

You assign [`Creative`](creative.md) objects to your [`Custom Product Pages`](custom-product-pages.md). You can assign one [`Creative`](creative.md) per custom product page per organization. After assigning your creative, the next step is to [`Create an Ad`](create-an-ad.md) object to assign to an ad group.
