#### Overview

Apple Ads is an efficient and easy way to help people discover your app when they search in the App Store. With Apple Ads Campaign Management API 5, you can build [`Campaigns`](campaigns.md) with budgets, and create ad groups that include keywords, audience refinement criteria, and scheduling.

You can implement your own keyword-bidding strategy in ad groups or [`Build a Campaign Keywords Strategy`](ad-groups#Build-a-Campaign-Keywords-Strategy.md) with the search match feature to automatically match your ad to relevant user searches in the App Store. Promote your campaigns to multiple countries or regions by creating ad variations in your App Store [`Custom Product Pages`](custom-product-pages.md). Measure the effectiveness of your campaigns by generating campaign [`Reports`](reports.md) and [`Impression Share Reports`](impression-share-reports.md) with meaningful metrics.
