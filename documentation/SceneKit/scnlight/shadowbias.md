# shadowBias

**Framework**: SceneKit  
**Kind**: property

The amount of correction to apply to the shadow to prevent rendering artifacts.

**Availability**:

- iPadOS ?+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- macOS 10.10+

## Declaration

```swift
var shadowBias: CGFloat { get set }
```

#### Discussion

Rendering shadows from a shadow map can result in artifacts where the shadow color does not appear on all pixels in a shadowed surface as intended. (This effect is typically called .) This property specifies the error margin SceneKit uses to correct such artifacts.

The default value is `1.0`.
