# Built-in Geometry Types

**Framework**: SceneKit

Basic shapes—such as spheres, boxes, and planes—and features for generating 3D objects from 2D text and Bézier curves.

## Topics

### Parametric Geometry
- [class SCNText](scntext.md)
  A geometry based on a string of text, optionally extruded to create a three-dimensional object.
- [class SCNShape](scnshape.md)
  A geometry based on a two-dimensional path, optionally extruded to create a three-dimensional object.
### Basic Shapes
- [class SCNFloor](scnfloor.md)
  A plane that can optionally display a reflection of the scene above it.
- [class SCNBox](scnbox.md)
  A six-sided polyhedron geometry whose faces are all rectangles, optionally with rounded edges and corners.
- [class SCNCapsule](scncapsule.md)
  A right circular cylinder geometry whose ends are capped with hemispheres.
- [class SCNCone](scncone.md)
  A right circular cone or frustum geometry.
- [class SCNCylinder](scncylinder.md)
  A right circular cylinder geometry.
- [class SCNPlane](scnplane.md)
  A rectangular, one-sided plane geometry of specified width and height.
- [class SCNPyramid](scnpyramid.md)
  A right rectangular pyramid geometry.
- [class SCNSphere](scnsphere.md)
  A sphere (or ball or globe) geometry.
- [class SCNTorus](scntorus.md)
  A torus, or ring-shaped geometry.
- [class SCNTube](scntube.md)
  A tube or pipe geometry—a right circular cylinder with a circular hole along its central axis.

## See Also

- [class SCNGeometry](scngeometry.md)
  A three-dimensional shape (also called a model or mesh) that can be displayed in a scene, with attached materials that define its appearance.
- [class SCNGeometrySource](scngeometrysource.md)
  A container for vertex data forming part of the definition for a three-dimensional object, or geometry.
- [class SCNGeometryElement](scngeometryelement.md)
  A container for index data describing how vertices connect to define a three-dimensional object, or geometry.
