## Declaration

```swift
var birthRate: CGFloat { get set }
```

```objc
@property (nonatomic) CGFloat birthRate;
```

#### Discussion

The system emits this number of particles at a constant rate through the duration of the period specified by the [`emissionDuration`](./emissionduration.md) property. A value of zero prevents the system from emitting particles, unless you randomize the birth rate with the [`birthRateVariation`](./birthratevariation.md) property.

The default value is `1`.

You can animate changes to this property’s value. See [Animating SceneKit Content](../animating-scenekit-content.md).
