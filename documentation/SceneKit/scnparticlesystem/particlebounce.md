## Declaration

```swift

```

#### Discussion

Restitution determines the amount of energy gained or lost in a collision. (To define collision behavior, see the [`colliderNodes`](scnparticlesystem/collidernodes.md) property.)

A value of `1.0` specifies that a particle loses no energy in a collision (for example, a particle that falls from a certain height onto a flat surface bounces back to the same height). Larger values specify energy gained, and smaller values specify a loss of energy. A value of `0.0` prevents particles from bouncing. You can randomize the bounce factors of particles in the system with the [`particleBounceVariation`](scnparticlesystem/particlebouncevariation.md) property.

The default value is `0.7`.

You can animate changes to this property’s value. See [`Animating SceneKit Content`](animating-scenekit-content.md).
