# imageSequenceAnimationMode

**Framework**: SceneKit  
**Kind**: property

The animation mode for particle image animation.

**Availability**:

## Declaration

```swift
var imageSequenceAnimationMode: SCNParticleImageSequenceAnimationMode { get set }
```

#### Discussion

The default value is [`SCNParticleImageSequenceAnimationMode.repeat`](scnparticleimagesequenceanimationmode/repeat.md), indicating that the image sequence loops continuously. For details on other values, see [`SCNParticleImageSequenceAnimationMode`](scnparticleimagesequenceanimationmode.md).
