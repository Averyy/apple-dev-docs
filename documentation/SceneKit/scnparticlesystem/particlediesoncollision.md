# particleDiesOnCollision

**Framework**: SceneKit  
**Kind**: property

A Boolean value that determines whether particles are removed from the scene upon colliding with another object.

**Availability**:
- iOS 8.0+
- iPadOS 8.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- macOS 10.8+
- tvOS 9.0+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
var particleDiesOnCollision: Bool { get set }
```

#### Discussion

This property has no effect if the [`colliderNodes`](scnparticlesystem/collidernodes.md) array is empty or contains no nodes with attached geometry.

The default value is [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false), specifying that particles remain in the scene after a collision. The [`particleBounce`](scnparticlesystem/particlebounce.md) and [`particleFriction`](scnparticlesystem/particlefriction.md) properties determine whether and how particles bounce or slide after colliding with a geometry.
