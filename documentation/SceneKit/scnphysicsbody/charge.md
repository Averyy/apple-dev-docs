#### Discussion

A body’s charge determines its behavior when affected by an electric or magnetic field. Use the [`SCNPhysicsField`](scnphysicsfield.md) class to add these fields to your scene. Bodies with positive or negative charges behave differently when affected by electric or magnetic fields. The default electric charge on a physics body is `0.0`, causing it to be unaffected by electric and magnetic fields.

Note that you need not use realistic measurements for the bodies in your app—the effects of the physics simulation depend on the relative masses of different bodies, not the absolute values. You may use whatever values produce the behavior or gameplay you’re looking for as long as you use them consistently.
