## Declaration

```swift
class func radialGravity() -> SCNPhysicsField
```

#### Return Value

A physics field object. To use the field in a scene, attach it to the [`physicsField`](scnnode/physicsfield.md) property of an [`SCNNode`](scnnode.md) object.

#### Discussion

Because the force of gravity on an object is proportional to the object’s mass, this force accelerates all objects at the same distance from the field’s center by the same amount. The field’s [`strength`](scnphysicsfield/strength.md) property measures this acceleration in meters per second per second.

By default, a radial gravity field attracts objects toward its center. To make it repel objects instead, set the field’s [`strength`](scnphysicsfield/strength.md) property to a negative value.

The default [`falloffExponent`](scnphysicsfield/falloffexponent.md) value for a radial gravity field is `2.0`, indicating that the field’s effect diminishes with the square of distance from its center.
