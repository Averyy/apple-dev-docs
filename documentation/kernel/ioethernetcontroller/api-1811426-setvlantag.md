# setVlanTag

**Framework**: Kernel  
**Kind**: instm

Encode a received packet with the vlan tag result reported by the hardware.

## Declaration

```swift
virtual void setVlanTag(
 mbuf_tm,
 UInt32vlanTag);
```

#### Overview

A network controller that can strip 802.1Q vlan tag information for a received packet should call this method to encode the result on the packet, before passing it up towards the protocol stacks.

## Parameters

- `m`: A mbuf containing a packet that has had its 802.1q vlan tag stripped by the hardware.
- `vlanTag`: A value in host order that contains the 802.1q vlan tag and priority in the low order 16 bits. The hi order word is currently unused and should be set to 0.
