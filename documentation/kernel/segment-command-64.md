## Topics

### Instance Properties
- [cmd](segment_command_64/1525290-cmd.md)
- [cmdsize](segment_command_64/1525853-cmdsize.md)
- [fileoff](segment_command_64/1525570-fileoff.md)
- [filesize](segment_command_64/1525530-filesize.md)
  Indicates the number of bytes occupied by this segment on disk. For segments that require more memory at runtime than they do at build time, `vmsize` can be larger than `filesize`. For example, the `__PAGEZERO` segment generated by the linker for `MH_EXECUTABLE` files has a `vmsize` of 0x1000 but a `filesize` of 0. Because `__PAGEZERO` contains no data, there is no need for it to occupy any space until runtime. Also, the static linker often allocates uninitialized data at the end of the `__DATA` segment; in this case, the `vmsize` is larger than the `filesize`. The loader guarantees that any memory of this sort is initialized with zeros.
