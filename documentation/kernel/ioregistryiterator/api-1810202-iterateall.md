# iterateAll

**Framework**: Kernel  
**Kind**: instm

Iterates all entries (with getNextObject) and returns a set of all returned entries.

## Declaration

```swift
virtual OSOrderedSet * iterateAll(
 void );
```

#### Return_value

A set of entries returned by the iteration. The caller should release the set when it has finished with it. Zero is returned on a resource failure.

#### Overview

This method will reset, then iterate all entries in the iteration (with getNextObject) until successful (ie. the iterator is valid at the end of the iteration).
