# IORecursiveLockLock

**Framework**: Kernel  
**Kind**: func

Lock a recursive lock.

**Availability**:
- DriverKit 24.4+
- macOS 10.0+

## Declaration

```swift
void IORecursiveLockLock(IORecursiveLock *lock);
```

#### Discussion

Lock the recursive lock. If the lock is held by another thread, block waiting for its unlock. This function may block and so should not be called from interrupt level or while a spin lock is held. The lock may be taken recursively by the same thread, with a balanced number of calls to IORecursiveLockUnlock.

## Parameters

- `lock`: Pointer to the allocated lock.
