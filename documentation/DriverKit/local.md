# LOCAL

**Framework**: DriverKit  
**Kind**: macro

Tells the system that the method runs locally in the driver extension’s process space.

**Availability**:
- DriverKit ?+
- iOS ?+
- iPadOS ?+
- macOS ?+

## Declaration

```swift
#define LOCAL
```

#### Discussion

DriverKit adds this macro to methods that must run locally in your driver extension. A method tagged with this macro may still be called by a remote process such as the kernel. Don’t add this macro to your own methods.

This macro applies only to methods.
