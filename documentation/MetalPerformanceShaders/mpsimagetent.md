## Declaration

```swift
class MPSImageTent
```

#### Overview

The kernel elements of the filter form a tent shape with increasing sides, for example:

Like a box filter, this arrangement allows for much faster algorithms, especially for larger blur radii but with a more pleasing appearance.

The tent blur is a separable filter and the Metal Performance Shaders framework will act accordingly to give the best performance for multi-dimensional blurs.

> **Note**:  The box filter, while fast, may yield square-ish looking blur effects. However, multiple passes of the box filter tend to smooth out with each additional pass. For example, two 3-wide box blurs produces the same effective convolution as a 5-wide tent blur. In effect, addition passes tend to approximate a Gaussian line shape.
