## Declaration

```swift
struct Lookahead<Output>
```

#### Overview

A lookahead is a zero-length assertion that its included regex matches at a particular position. Lookaheads do not advance the overall matching position in the input string — once a lookahead succeeds, matching continues in the regex from the same position.
