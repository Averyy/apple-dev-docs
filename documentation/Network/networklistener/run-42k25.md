```

#### Discussion

Multiplexed connections are connections that contain one or more multiplexing protocols in their protocol stack. They vend connections that represent one logical transport connection, defined by local and remote address, port, and interface or by a protocol-specific connection identifier. Multiple uni- or bi-directional bytestreams and datagram flows are commonly multiplexed over these transport connections and can be obtained from the transport connection directly.

When the listener state moves to ready, the listener is registered with the system and can receive incoming connections.

`run()` should only be called once on a listener, and multiple calls to `run()` will throw an exception.

The closure inherits the isolation domain of the caller.

## Parameters

- `handler`: A handler to receive incoming multiplexed connections.
