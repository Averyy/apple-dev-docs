  Sends data on a connection.
- [func send<Content>(content: Content?, contentContext: NWConnection.ContentContext, isComplete: Bool, completion: NWConnection.SendCompletion)](nwconnection/send(content:contentcontext:iscomplete:completion:)-3mfmt.md)
  Sends data on a connection using a custom Data type.
- [func receive(minimumIncompleteLength: Int, maximumLength: Int, completion: (Data?, NWConnection.ContentContext?, Bool, NWError?) -> Void)](nwconnection/receive(minimumincompletelength:maximumlength:completion:).md)
  Schedules a single receive completion handler, with a range indicating how many bytes the handler can receive at one time.
- [func receiveMessage(completion: (Data?, NWConnection.ContentContext?, Bool, NWError?) -> Void)](nwconnection/receivemessage(completion:).md)
