#### Discussion

Use the black button on white or light backgrounds that provide sufficient contrast. Don’t place this button on dark or saturated color backgrounds. Use the white button instead.

In many cases, you can choose either the white button with black outline or the black button. Select the button that works best with your user interface. Always use a single style throughout your app.
