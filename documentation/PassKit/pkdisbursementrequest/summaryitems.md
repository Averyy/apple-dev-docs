## Declaration

```swift
var summaryItems: [PKPaymentSummaryItem] { get set }
```

#### Discussion

This array must contain one [`PKPaymentSummaryItem`](pkpaymentsummaryitem.md), which contains the amount the individual receives. This may differ from the total amount withdrawn — for example, if the transfer has an associated fee. The framework displays the amount this [`PKPaymentSummaryItem`](pkpaymentsummaryitem.md) item represents on the main Apple Pay sheet.

This array may contain up to one [`PKInstantFundsOutFeeSummaryItem`](pkinstantfundsoutfeesummaryitem.md) to represent a fee deducted as part of an instant transfer, if applicable. The framework also presents this fee on the main sheet when you initialize the [`PKDisbursementRequest`](pkdisbursementrequest.md) with the [`instantFundsOut`](pkmerchantcapability/instantfundsout.md) capability option.

You can specify other line items (such as fees not associated with an instant transfer) using [`PKPaymentSummaryItem`](pkpaymentsummaryitem.md).

If you specify multiple summary items, the last item must represent the total of all previous items.
