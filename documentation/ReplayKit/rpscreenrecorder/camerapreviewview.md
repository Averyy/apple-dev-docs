#### Discussion

When the value in the [`isCameraEnabled`](rpscreenrecorder/iscameraenabled.md) property is [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), this property contains a view with the live camera view. If the camera isn’t enabled, the value in this property is `nil`. When the app runs in visionOS, the value in this property is `nil`.
