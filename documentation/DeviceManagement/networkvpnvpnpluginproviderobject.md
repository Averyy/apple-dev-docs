## Declaration

```swift
object NetworkVPNVPNPluginProviderObject
```

## Properties

- `ComposedIdentifier` (string): If the `SubType` field contains the bundle identifier of an app that contains multiple VPN providers of the same type (app-proxy or packet-tunnel), then the system uses this field to choose which provider to use for this configuration. If the VPN provider is implemented as a System Extension, then this field is required. In iOS, tvOS, and visionOS, the identifier is a bundle ID, for example, “com.example.app”. In macOS, the identifier is a composed identifier. The format of the composed identifier is either “Bundle-ID” or “Bundle-ID {Designated-Requirement}”. “Bundle-ID” is the bundle identifier string of the provider. “Designated-Requirement” is the designated requirement string from the code signature of the provider. For example, “com.example.app” for the bundle ID format, or “com.example.app {anchor apple generic}” for the designated requirement format.
- `Type` (string): The type of VPN service. If the value is `app-proxy`, the service tunnels traffic at the app level. If the value is `packet-tunnel`, the service tunnels traffic at the IP layer.
