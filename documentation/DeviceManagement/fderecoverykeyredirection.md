# FDERecoveryKeyRedirection

**Framework**: Device Management  
**Kind**: dictionary

The payload that configures FileVault recovery key redirection.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.9+

## Declaration

```swift
object FDERecoveryKeyRedirection
```

#### Discussion

Specify `com.apple.security.FDERecoveryRedirect` as the payload type.

Although the previous FDE Recovery payload is no longer supported in macOS 10.13 and later, it’s still supported in macOS 10.9 through 10.12. When installed, this payload causes any FDE recovery keys to be redirected to the specified URL instead of being sent to Apple. This requires sites to implement their own HTTPS server to receive the recovery keys through a POST request.

Note these cautions:

- The payload must exist in a system-scoped profile.
- Installing more than one payload of this type per machine results in an error.
