## Declaration

```swift
object NetworkVPNIKEV2AuthenticationObject
```

## Topics

### Objects
- [object NetworkVPNIKEV2Authentication_ExtendedAuthObject](networkvpnikev2authentication_extendedauthobject.md)
  Specifies details about how the VPN routes different types of network traffic.

## Properties

- `CredentialsAssetReference` (string): The identifier of an asset declaration that contains the credentials (password) to authenticate with the VPN server. Required when `Authentication.Method` is set to `SharedSecret`.
- `ExtendedAuth` (NetworkVPNIKEV2Authentication_ExtendedAuthObject): Specifies details about how the VPN routes different types of network traffic.
- `IdentityAssetReference` (string): The identifier of a credential asset declaration that contains the identity that this account requires to authenticate with the VPN server. If the value of `AuthenticationMethod` is `Certificate`, the system sends this certificate out for IKEv2 machine authentication. If extended authentication (EAP) is used, the system sends this certificate out for EAP-TLS authentication. Required when `Authentication.Method` is set to `Certificate`.
- `IdentityCertificateType` (string): The type of key used by the identity set in the `IdentityAssetReference` to use for IKEv2 machine authentication. If this key is included, the system requires a value for `ServerCertificateIssuerCommonName`.
- `Method` (string) *(required)*: The type of authentication method for the VPN. To enable EAP-only authentication, set this to `None` and `ExtendedAuthEnabled` to `true`. If this is `None` and the `ExtendedAuthEnabled` key isn’t set, the authentication configuration defaults to `SharedSecret`.
