# QCCompositionRepository

**Framework**: Quartz  
**Kind**: class

The `QCCompositionRepository` class represents a system-wide centralized repository of built-in and installed Quartz Composer compositions (`/Library/Compositions` and `~/Library/Compositions`). The `QCCompositionRepository` class cannot be subclassed.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.4+

## Declaration

```swift
class QCCompositionRepository
```

#### Overview

Compositions in the repository are represented by the [`QCComposition`](qccomposition.md) class. You can use the methods of the `QCCompositionRepository` class to fetch all compositions or only those that meet specific criteria.

## Topics

### Getting the Composition Repository
- [class func shared() -> QCCompositionRepository!](qccompositionrepository/shared.md)
  Returns the shared instance of the composition repository.
### Fetching Compositions
- [func composition(withIdentifier: String!) -> QCComposition!](qccompositionrepository/composition(withidentifier:).md)
  Returns the composition that corresponds to the identifier.
- [func compositions(withProtocols: [Any]!, andAttributes: [AnyHashable : Any]!) -> [Any]!](qccompositionrepository/compositions(withprotocols:andattributes:).md)
  Returns an array of compositions that match a set of criteria.
- [func allCompositions() -> [Any]!](qccompositionrepository/allcompositions.md)
  Returns an array that contains all compositions currently in the composition repository.

## See Also

- [class QCComposition](qccomposition.md)
  The `QCComposition` class represents a Quartz Composer composition that either:
- [class QCCompositionLayer](qccompositionlayer.md)
  A layer that loads, plays, and controls Quartz Composer compositions in a Core Animation layer hierarchy.
- [class QCCompositionParameterView](qccompositionparameterview.md)
  A class that allows users to edit the input parameters of a composition in real time. The composition can be rendering in any of the following objects: [`QCRenderer`](qcrenderer.md), [`QCView`](qcview.md), or [`QCCompositionLayer`](qccompositionlayer.md).
- [class QCCompositionPickerPanel](qccompositionpickerpanel.md)
  The `QCCompositionPickerPanel` class represents a utility window that allows users to browse compositions that are in the Quartz Composer composition repository and, if supported, preview the composition. The `QCCompositionPickerPanel` class cannot be subclassed.
- [class QCCompositionPickerView](qccompositionpickerview.md)
  The `QCCompositionPickerView` class allows users to browse compositions that are in the Quartz Composer composition repository, and to preview them. You can set the default input parameters for a composition preview  by using the method setDefaultValue:forInputKey:.
- [class QCPatchController](qcpatchcontroller.md)
- [class QCPlugIn](qcplugin.md)
  A base class to subclass for writing custom patches.
- [class QCPlugInViewController](qcpluginviewcontroller.md)
  The `QCPlugInViewController` class communicates (through Cocoa bindings) between a custom patch and the view used for the internal settings of the custom patch. Only custom patches that use internal settings exposed to the user need to use the `QCPlugInViewController` class.
- [class QCRenderer](qcrenderer.md)
  A base class for low-level rendering.
- [class QCView](qcview.md)
  The `QCView` class is a custom `NSView` class that loads, plays, and controls Quartz Composer compositions. It is an autonomous view that is driven by an internal timer running on the main thread.
