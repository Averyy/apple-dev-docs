# beginSheet(options:modalFor:modalDelegate:didEnd:contextInfo:)

**Framework**: Quartz  
**Kind**: method

Displays the filter browser in a sheet—that is, a dialog that is attached to its parent window and must be dismissed by the user.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.4+

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
func beginSheet(options inOptions: [AnyHashable : Any]! = [:], modalFor docWindow: NSWindow!, modalDelegate: Any!, didEnd didEndSelector: Selector!, contextInfo: UnsafeMutableRawPointer!)
```

#### Discussion

When the filter browser session ends, `didEndSelector` is invoked on the modeless delegate, passing `contextInfo` as an argument. The selector `didEndSelector` must have the following signature:

`- (void)openPanelDidEnd:(NSOpenPanel *)panel returnCode:(int)returnCode  contextInfo:(void  *)contextInfo`

The `returnCode` value passed to the selector is set to [`NSOKButton`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSOKButton) if the user validates, or to [`NSCancelButton`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSCancelButton) if the user cancels.

## Parameters

- `inOptions`: A dictionary of options that describe the configuration to use for the filter browser user interface. For the possible keys you can supply see    and the constant  .
- `docWindow`: The parent window for the dialog.
- `modalDelegate`: The object that will invoke the selector    when the filter browser session terminates.
- `didEndSelector`: The selector to invoke when the filter browser session terminates.
- `contextInfo`: Any data that must be passed as an argument to the delegate through   after the filter browser session terminates.
