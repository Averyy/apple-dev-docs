# QCPlugInViewController

**Framework**: Quartz  
**Kind**: class

The `QCPlugInViewController` class communicates (through Cocoa bindings) between a custom patch and the view used for the internal settings of the custom patch. Only custom patches that use internal settings exposed to the user need to use the `QCPlugInViewController` class.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.4+

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
class QCPlugInViewController
```

#### Overview

You access the internal settings of a custom patch through key-value coding (KVC). All the KVC keys that represent the internal settings of the custom patch must be listed in its `plugInKeys` method.

The view controller for a custom patch expects

- the nib file `File's Owner`  class set to the `QCPlugInViewController` class
- the view outlet connected to the view that contains the editing controls

The controls are bound to the `File's Owner`  as the target and `plugIn.XXX` as the model key path, where `XXX` is the KVC key for a given internal setting of the custom patch instance.

## Topics

### Creating a Controller
- [init!(plugIn: QCPlugIn!, viewNibName: String!)](qcpluginviewcontroller/init(plugin:viewnibname:).md)
  Creates and initializes a controller for the specified `QCPlugIn` object and nib file.
### Getting the QCPlugIn Object
- [func plugIn() -> QCPlugIn!](qcpluginviewcontroller/plugin.md)
  Returns the `QCPlugIn` object associated with the view controller for the custom patch.

  The `QCComposition` class represents a Quartz Composer composition that either:
- [class QCCompositionLayer](qccompositionlayer.md)
  A layer that loads, plays, and controls Quartz Composer compositions in a Core Animation layer hierarchy.
- [class QCCompositionParameterView](qccompositionparameterview.md)
  A class that allows users to edit the input parameters of a composition in real time. The composition can be rendering in any of the following objects: [`QCRenderer`](qcrenderer.md), [`QCView`](qcview.md), or [`QCCompositionLayer`](qccompositionlayer.md).
- [class QCCompositionPickerPanel](qccompositionpickerpanel.md)
  The `QCCompositionPickerPanel` class represents a utility window that allows users to browse compositions that are in the Quartz Composer composition repository and, if supported, preview the composition. The `QCCompositionPickerPanel` class cannot be subclassed.
- [class QCCompositionPickerView](qccompositionpickerview.md)
  The `QCCompositionPickerView` class allows users to browse compositions that are in the Quartz Composer composition repository, and to preview them. You can set the default input parameters for a composition preview  by using the method setDefaultValue:forInputKey:.
- [class QCCompositionRepository](qccompositionrepository.md)
  The `QCCompositionRepository` class represents a system-wide centralized repository of built-in and installed Quartz Composer compositions (`/Library/Compositions` and `~/Library/Compositions`). The `QCCompositionRepository` class cannot be subclassed.

- [class QCPlugIn](qcplugin.md)
  A base class to subclass for writing custom patches.
- [class QCRenderer](qcrenderer.md)
  A base class for low-level rendering.
- [class QCView](qcview.md)
  The `QCView` class is a custom `NSView` class that loads, plays, and controls Quartz Composer compositions. It is an autonomous view that is driven by an internal timer running on the main thread.
