- [class QCCompositionParameterView](qccompositionparameterview.md)
  A class that allows users to edit the input parameters of a composition in real time. The composition can be rendering in any of the following objects: [`QCRenderer`](qcrenderer.md), [`QCView`](qcview.md), or [`QCCompositionLayer`](qccompositionlayer.md).
- [class QCCompositionPickerPanel](qccompositionpickerpanel.md)
  The `QCCompositionPickerPanel` class represents a utility window that allows users to browse compositions that are in the Quartz Composer composition repository and, if supported, preview the composition. The `QCCompositionPickerPanel` class cannot be subclassed.
- [class QCCompositionPickerView](qccompositionpickerview.md)
  The `QCCompositionPickerView` class allows users to browse compositions that are in the Quartz Composer composition repository, and to preview them. You can set the default input parameters for a composition preview  by using the method setDefaultValue:forInputKey:.
- [class QCCompositionRepository](qccompositionrepository.md)

- [class QCRenderer](qcrenderer.md)
  A base class for low-level rendering.
- [class QCView](qcview.md)
  The `QCView` class is a custom `NSView` class that loads, plays, and controls Quartz Composer compositions. It is an autonomous view that is driven by an internal timer running on the main thread.
