# Data Binding Queries

**Framework**: TVML

Compare a value from a JSON file to another value.

#### Overview

Using these queries with JSON information and the `specialize` element provides developers with the ability to modify existing elements. These queries are used to compare one value with another, and the contained action is carried out when the comparison evaluates to `true`.
