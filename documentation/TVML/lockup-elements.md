# Lockup Elements

**Framework**: TVML

Combine several elements so that they can be treated as a single element.

#### Overview

Lockup elements are often contained inside of other compound elements, especially shelves. By combining several elements together and treating them as a single element, lockup elements can be arranged and displayed in a consistent fashion by other elements.
