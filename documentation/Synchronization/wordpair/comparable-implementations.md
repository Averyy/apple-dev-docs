### Operators
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeThrough<Self>](wordpair/'...(_:)-3zypg.md)
  Returns a partial range up to, and including, its upper bound.
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeFrom<Self>](wordpair/'...(_:)-83e98.md)
  Returns a partial range extending upward from a lower bound.
- [static func ... (Self, Self) -> ClosedRange<Self>](wordpair/'...(_:_:).md)
  Returns a closed range that contains both of its bounds.
- [static func ..< (Self) -> PartialRangeUpTo<Self>](wordpair/'.._(_:).md)
  Returns a partial range up to, but not including, its upper bound.
- [static func ..< (Self, Self) -> Range<Self>](wordpair/'.._(_:_:).md)
  Returns a half-open range that contains its lower bound but not its upper bound.
- [static func < (WordPair, WordPair) -> Bool](wordpair/_(_:_:).md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than that of the second argument.
- [static func > (Self, Self) -> Bool](wordpair/_(_:_:)-2c9ig.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func <= (Self, Self) -> Bool](wordpair/_=(_:_:)-1kwoh.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (Self, Self) -> Bool](wordpair/_=(_:_:)-7jnh3.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
