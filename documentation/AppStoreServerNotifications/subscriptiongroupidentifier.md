#### Discussion

Auto-renewable subscriptions always belong to a subscription group. You create the subscription group identifiers in App Store Connect before you create and add an auto-renewable subscription. For more information about subscription groups, see [`Offer auto-renewable subscriptions`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev75708c031).
