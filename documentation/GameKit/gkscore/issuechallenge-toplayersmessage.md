# issueChallenge(toPlayers:message:)

**Framework**: GameKit  
**Kind**: method

Issues a score challenge to a set of players.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.8+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
func issueChallenge(toPlayers playerIDs: [String]?, message: String?)
```

#### Discussion

Set up your game to issue a challenge request only in direct response to a player action. That is, your game provides a user interface that allows the player to choose to issue a challenge and choose which friends receive the challenge, and only issue a challenge when the player wishes to do so.

## Parameters

- `playerIDs`: The identifiers for the players to challenge. Because Game Center limits the number of players in a challenge request to 10, the maximum size of this array is 10.
- `message`: A text message to display to the players.
