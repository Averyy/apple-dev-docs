## Declaration

```swift

```

#### Discussion

This property is invalid on a newly initialized score object. On a score returned from GameKit, it contains a formatted string based on the player’s score. You determine how a score is formatted when you define the leaderboard in App Store Connect.

Never convert the `value` property into a string directly; always use this method to receive the formatted string.

> ❗ **Important**:  You may be tempted to write your own formatting code rather than using the `formattedValue` property. Do not do this. Using the built-in support makes it easy to localize the score value into other languages, and provides a string that is consistent with the presentation of your scores in the Game Center app.
