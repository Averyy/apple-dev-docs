#### Discussion

If not modified, these are the environment variables that Xcode passes to the application on launch. You can change, add to, or remove the environment variables. Unlike with [`Process`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/process), you can modify the environment variables after the application launches. Such changes don’t affect the current launch session, but do take effect the next time the application launches.
