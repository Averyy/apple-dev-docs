# titleVisibility

**Framework**: MapKit JS  
**Kind**: property

A value that determines the behavior of the title’s visibility.

**Availability**:
- MapKit JS 5.74.1+

## Declaration

```swift
get titleVisibility(): FeatureVisibility;
```

#### Discussion

Use one of the [`FeatureVisibility`](featurevisibility.md) values to control how the framework displays the title’s visibility. The default is [`Adaptive`](featurevisibility/adaptive.md).

You can’t set the title visibility property of the map feature annotation.
