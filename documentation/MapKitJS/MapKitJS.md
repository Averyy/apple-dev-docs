# MapKit JS

**Framework**: MapKit JS  
**Kind**: module

Embed interactive Apple Maps on your website, annotate points of interest, and perform georelated searches.

**Availability**:
- MapKit JS 5.0+

#### Overview

Use this JavaScript API to embed interactive maps directly into your webpages or apps across different platforms and operating systems, including iOS and Android. Like [`MapKit`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MapKit) for native apps, you can also add annotations and overlays to the map to call out points of interest or user destinations.
