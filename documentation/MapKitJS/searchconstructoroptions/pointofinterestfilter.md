# pointOfInterestFilter

**Framework**: MapKit JS  
**Kind**: property

A filter used to include or exclude point of interest categories.

**Availability**:
- MapKit JS 5.32.2+

## Declaration

```swift
attribute mapkit.PointOfInterestFilter pointOfInterestFilter;
```

#### Discussion

If you provide a [`mapkit.PointOfInterestFilter`](mapkit.pointofinterestfilter.md) and set [`includePointsOfInterest`](searchconstructoroptions/includepointsofinterest.md) to `false`, the filter takes precedence and MapKit JS ignores the Boolean.

## See Also

- [includePointsOfInterest](searchconstructoroptions/includepointsofinterest.md)
  A Boolean value that indicates whether the search results should include points of interest.
