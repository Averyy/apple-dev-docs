# Dispatch Data

**Framework**: Dispatch

An object that manages a memory-based data buffer and exposes it as a contiguous block of memory.

#### Overview

The memory buffer managed by this object may be a single contiguous block of memory, or it may consist of multiple discontiguous blocks. For the discontiguous case, the dispatch data object makes it appear as if the memory is contiguous.

## Topics
