#### Discussion

Specifies reverse portrait orientation. Reverse portrait orientation performs a 180° rotation on the logical page rectangle and sets the Quartz origin to the upper-right corner of the unrotated logical page with positive y-values increasing downwards. This has the effect of rotating the logical page image 180°. Reverse portrait orientation is supported in macOS 10.5 and later.
