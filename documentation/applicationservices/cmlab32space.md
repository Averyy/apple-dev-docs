#### Discussion

An L*a*b* color space composed of L*, a*, and b* components whose values are packed with 10 bits per component. The storage size for a color value expressed in this color space is 32 bits, with the high-order 2 bits not used. The 10-bit unsigned a* and b* channels are interpreted numerically as ranging from -128.0 to approximately 128.0.
