#### Discussion

The global screen coordinates of the top-left corner of this accessibility object. Note that the coordinates `0`,`0` represent the top-left corner of the screen that displays the menu bar. All accessibility objects that have a screen position (in other words, are visible on the screen) should include this attribute.
