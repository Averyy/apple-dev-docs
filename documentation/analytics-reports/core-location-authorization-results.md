# Core Location Authorization Results

**Framework**: Analytics Reports

Review authorizations that people grant as a result of requests from your app.

#### Overview

The data in this report counts the authorizations that people grant when an app requests a specific authorization.

- Territories: Worldwide
- Platforms: iOS, iPadOS.  For more information about iOS and iPadOS, see the Platforms section in [`Data Completeness and Corrections`](data-completeness-corrections.md).
- Availability: - Daily: Every day.
- History: On request, data is available beginning with iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4.
- Completeness: Data from devices that contribute to this report can arrive as late as 8 days after the date it generates on device. You can download recent data daily, but it might be incomplete, and data updates incrementally daily, until all late-arriving events are available.
- Privacy: - Includes data from users who have opted to share their data with Apple and developers.
- Individual rows will only appear if they have a value of 5 or more.
- Data Context: You can analyze your data with additional context by comparing it with the data in the [`App Sessions Context`](app-sessions-context.md) report, which provides a count of unique devices that use your app on a specific day. For example, if your app performed an action detailed in this report on 10 unique devices on a specific day, and the App Sessions Context report shows there were 100 unique devices running your app that day, then you can approximate that 10% of the devices running your app performed that action.
