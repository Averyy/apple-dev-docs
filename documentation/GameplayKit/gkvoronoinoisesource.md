## Declaration

```swift
class GKVoronoiNoiseSource
```

#### Overview

Voronoi noise can generate textures resembling natural phenomena such as crystalline structures, cracked mud, or star fields.

Like all [`GKNoiseSource`](gknoisesource.md) subclasses, a Voronoi noise source represents a noise generation algorithm and its parameters. To make use of a noise source, first create [`GKNoise`](gknoise.md) object from it (and optionally apply operations to that noise object or combine it with other noise objects). Then create a [`GKNoiseMap`](gknoisemap.md) object from your noise object, generating a concrete field of values that you can sample from directly or visualize using the [`SKTexture`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SpriteKit/SKTexture) or `SKTileMap` class.

## Topics

### Creating a Noise Source
- [init(frequency: Double, displacement: Double, distanceEnabled: Bool, seed: Int32)](gkvoronoinoisesource/init(frequency:displacement:distanceenabled:seed:).md)
  Initializes a Voronoi noise source with the specified parameters.
- [class func voronoiNoise(withFrequency: Double, displacement: Double, distanceEnabled: Bool, seed: Int32) -> Self](gkvoronoinoisesource/voronoinoise(withfrequency:displacement:distanceenabled:seed:).md)
  Creates a Voronoi noise source with the specified parameters.
### Managing Noise Generation Parameters
- [var frequency: Double](gkvoronoinoisesource/frequency.md)
  A value that determines the number and size of cells in generated noise.
- [var displacement: Double](gkvoronoinoisesource/displacement.md)
  The range of random values to assign to each cell in generated noise.
- [var isDistanceEnabled: Bool](gkvoronoinoisesource/isdistanceenabled.md)
  A Boolean value that specifies whether generated noise values incorporate the distance from each point to the nearest seed point.
- [var seed: Int32](gkvoronoinoisesource/seed.md)
  The value that determines the specific configuration of noise produced by the noise source.
