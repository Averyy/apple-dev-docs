## Declaration

```swift
class GKPerlinNoiseSource
```

#### Overview

Like all [`GKNoiseSource`](gknoisesource.md) subclasses, a Perlin noise source represents a noise generation algorithm and its parameters. To make use of a noise source, first create [`GKNoise`](gknoise.md) object from it (and optionally apply operations to that noise object or combine it with other noise objects). Then create a [`GKNoiseMap`](gknoisemap.md) object from your noise object, generating a concrete field of values that you can sample from directly or visualize using the [`SKTexture`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SpriteKit/SKTexture) or `SKTileMap` class.

## Topics

### Creating a Noise Source
- [init(frequency: Double, octaveCount: Int, persistence: Double, lacunarity: Double, seed: Int32)](gkperlinnoisesource/init(frequency:octavecount:persistence:lacunarity:seed:).md)
  Initializes a Perlin noise source with the specified parameters.
### Managing Noise Generation Parameters
- [var persistence: Double](gkperlinnoisesource/persistence.md)
  The rate at which successive octaves of the noise function decrease in amplitude.
