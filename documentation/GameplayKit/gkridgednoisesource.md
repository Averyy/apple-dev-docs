## Declaration

```swift
class GKRidgedNoiseSource
```

#### Overview

Ridged noise is similar to Perlin noise (see the [`GKPerlinNoiseSource`](gkperlinnoisesource.md) class), but with thinner features resembling natural phenomena such as forked lightning and mountain peaks.

Like all [`GKNoiseSource`](gknoisesource.md) subclasses, a ridged noise source represents a noise generation algorithm and its parameters. To make use of a noise source, first create [`GKNoise`](gknoise.md) object from it (and optionally apply operations to that noise object or combine it with other noise objects). Then create a [`GKNoiseMap`](gknoisemap.md) object from your noise object, generating a concrete field of values that you can sample from directly or visualize using the [`SKTexture`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SpriteKit/SKTexture) or `SKTileMap` class.

## Topics

### Creating a Noise Source
- [init(frequency: Double, octaveCount: Int, lacunarity: Double, seed: Int32)](gkridgednoisesource/init(frequency:octavecount:lacunarity:seed:).md)
  Initializes a ridged noise source with the specified parameters.
