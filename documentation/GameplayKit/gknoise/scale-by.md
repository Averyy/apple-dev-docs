## Declaration

```swift
func scale(by factor: vector_double3)
```

#### Discussion

A noise field is inherently three-dimensional and infinite in extent; when you create a [`GKNoiseMap`](gknoisemap.md) object from a noise object, the resulting array of noise values is a “slice” of the noise field (through its `z = 0` plane, with a specified size and position). By translating, rotating, and scaling the noise field in 3D before you create a noise map, you can create interesting effects. For example, applying a non-uniform scale to noise generated by a [`GKVoronoiNoiseSource`](gkvoronoinoisesource.md) object creates patterns similar to water waves.

## Parameters

- `factor`: A vector whose x, y, and z components each provide a scale factor for the corresponding axis in the noise field.

  Translates the entire noise field by the specified x, y, and z offsets.
- [func rotate(by: vector_double3)](gknoise/rotate(by:).md)
  Rotates the entire noise field by the specified x, y, and z angles.
