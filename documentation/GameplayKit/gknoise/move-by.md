## Declaration

```swift
func move(by delta: vector_double3)
```

#### Discussion

A noise field is inherently three-dimensional and infinite in extent; when you create a [`GKNoiseMap`](gknoisemap.md) object from a noise object, the resulting array of noise values is a “slice” of the noise field (through its `z = 0` plane, with a specified size and position). By translating, rotating, and scaling the noise field in 3D before you create a noise map, you can create interesting effects. For example, by applying a series of translations along the z-axis to noise generated by a [`GKPerlinNoiseSource`](gkperlinnoisesource.md) object, you can generate a series of texture images for creating an animated billowing clouds effect.

## Parameters

- `delta`: A vector whose x, y, and z components each provide a translation offset for the corresponding axis in the noise field.
