## Declaration

```swift
class GKCheckerboardNoiseSource
```

#### Overview

Checkerboard noise can be useful as an input to [`GKNoise`](gknoise.md) methods that create noise by combining other noise objects through various operations.

![None](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/c7287dfc2eb706d0a1b3323492787832/media-2556325%402x.png)

Like all [`GKNoiseSource`](gknoisesource.md) subclasses, a checkerboard noise source represents a noise generation algorithm and its parameters. To make use of a noise source, first create [`GKNoise`](gknoise.md) object from it (and optionally apply operations to that noise object or combine it with other noise objects). Then create a [`GKNoiseMap`](gknoisemap.md) object from your noise object, generating a concrete field of values that you can sample from directly or visualize using the [`SKTexture`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SpriteKit/SKTexture) or `SKTileMap` class.

## Topics

### Creating a Noise Source
- [init(squareSize: Double)](gkcheckerboardnoisesource/init(squaresize:).md)
  Initializes a checkerboard noise source with the specified square size.
- [class func checkerboardNoise(withSquareSize: Double) -> Self](gkcheckerboardnoisesource/checkerboardnoise(withsquaresize:).md)
  Creates a checkerboard noise source with the specified square size.
### Managing Noise Generation Parameters
- [var squareSize: Double](gkcheckerboardnoisesource/squaresize.md)
  The size (both width and height) of squares in the generated checkerboard pattern.
