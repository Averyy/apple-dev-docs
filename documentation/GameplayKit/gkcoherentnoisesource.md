## Declaration

```swift
class GKCoherentNoiseSource
```

#### Overview

In general,  is randomness across a (one-, two-, three-, or many-dimensional) domain—for example, you can create noise by filling an image with values from a random number generator. Unlike such truly random noise,  is consistent and smooth: you can always generate the same output from a specific seed value, and small variations across the domain create only small variations in noise values.

You don’t instantiate or work directly with this class. Instead, the concrete subclasses of [`GKCoherentNoiseSource`](gkcoherentnoisesource.md) each provide a different style of coherent noise.

## Topics

### Managing Noise Generation Parameters
- [var frequency: Double](gkcoherentnoisesource/frequency.md)
  A value that determines the size and spacing of features in generated noise.
- [var octaveCount: Int](gkcoherentnoisesource/octavecount.md)
  The number of octaves of the underlying noise function to use for generating noise.
- [var lacunarity: Double](gkcoherentnoisesource/lacunarity.md)
  The rate at which successive octaves of the noise function increase in frequency.
- [var seed: Int32](gkcoherentnoisesource/seed.md)
  The value that determines the specific configuration of noise produced by the noise source.
