## Declaration

```swift
class GKGridGraphNode
```

#### Overview

Together, a network of nodes form a graph that describes the navigability of a game world. Use graph nodes with a [`GKGridGraph`](gkgridgraph.md) object (and methods of its superclass [`GKGraph`](gkgraph.md)) to perform actions that relate to the network of nodes as a whole, such as pathfinding to determine routes through the network.

To learn more about graphs and pathfinding, see [`Pathfinding`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/GameplayKit_Guide/Pathfinding.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015172-CH3) in [`GameplayKit Programming Guide`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/GameplayKit_Guide/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015172).

## Topics

### Creating a Graph Node
- [init(gridPosition: vector_int2)](gkgridgraphnode/init(gridposition:).md)
  Initializes a graph node with the specified position on a grid.
### Inspecting a Node’s Position
- [var gridPosition: vector_int2](gkgridgraphnode/gridposition.md)
  The position of the node on a discrete integer grid.
