## Declaration

```swift

```

#### Discussion

Like the [`seed`](gkarc4randomsource/seed.md) value of a random source, a noise source’s seed value determines the pseudorandom aspect of noise generated by the noise source. Changing the seed value produces different overall structure to the generated noise, while changing other parameters produces variation upon that structure.

## See Also

- [var frequency: Double](gkvoronoinoisesource/frequency.md)
  A value that determines the number and size of cells in generated noise.
- [var displacement: Double](gkvoronoinoisesource/displacement.md)
  The range of random values to assign to each cell in generated noise.
- [var isDistanceEnabled: Bool](gkvoronoinoisesource/isdistanceenabled.md)
  A Boolean value that specifies whether generated noise values incorporate the distance from each point to the nearest seed point.
