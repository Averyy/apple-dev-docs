## Declaration

```swift
class GKConstantNoiseSource
```

#### Overview

Constant noise can be useful as an input to [`GKNoise`](gknoise.md) methods that create noise by combining other noise objects through various operations. For example, when using the [`displaceWithNoises(x:y:z:)`](gknoise/displacewithnoises(x:y:z:).md) method you can pass constant noise for some parameters and non-constant noise for other parameters, resulting in a variable displacement along one axis but constant or no displacement along the others.

Like all [`GKNoiseSource`](gknoisesource.md) subclasses, a constant noise source represents a noise generation algorithm and its parameters. To make use of a noise source, first create [`GKNoise`](gknoise.md) object from it (and optionally apply operations to that noise object or combine it with other noise objects). Then create a [`GKNoiseMap`](gknoisemap.md) object from your noise object, generating a concrete field of values that you can sample from directly or visualize using the [`SKTexture`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SpriteKit/SKTexture) or `SKTileMap` class.

## Topics

### Creating a Noise Source
- [init(value: Double)](gkconstantnoisesource/init(value:).md)
  Initializes a noise source with the specified constant value.
- [class func constantNoise(withValue: Double) -> Self](gkconstantnoisesource/constantnoise(withvalue:).md)
  Creates a noise source with the specified constant value.
### Managing Noise Generation Parameters
- [var value: Double](gkconstantnoisesource/value.md)
  The constant value for the generated noise.
