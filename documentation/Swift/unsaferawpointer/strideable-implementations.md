# Strideable Implementations

**Framework**: Swift

## Topics

### Operators
- [static func + (Self, Self.Stride) -> Self](unsaferawpointer/+(_:_:)-5q1dn.md)
- [static func + (Self.Stride, Self) -> Self](unsaferawpointer/+(_:_:)-7xyjr.md)
- [static func += (inout Self, Self.Stride)](unsaferawpointer/+=(_:_:).md)
- [static func - (Self, Self) -> Self.Stride](unsaferawpointer/-(_:_:)-2mzya.md)
- [static func - (Self, Self.Stride) -> Self](unsaferawpointer/-(_:_:)-7vacm.md)
- [static func -= (inout Self, Self.Stride)](unsaferawpointer/-=(_:_:).md)
### Instance Methods
- [func advanced(by: Int) -> UnsafeRawPointer](unsaferawpointer/advanced(by:).md)
  Returns a value that is offset the specified distance from this value.
### Type Aliases
- [UnsafeRawPointer.Stride](unsaferawpointer/stride.md)
  A type that represents the distance between two values.
