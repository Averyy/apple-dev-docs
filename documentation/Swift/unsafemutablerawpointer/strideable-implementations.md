**Framework**: Swift

## Topics

### Operators
- [static func + (Self, Self.Stride) -> Self](unsafemutablerawpointer/+(_:_:)-5q1cr.md)
- [static func + (Self.Stride, Self) -> Self](unsafemutablerawpointer/+(_:_:)-7xyiv.md)
- [static func += (inout Self, Self.Stride)](unsafemutablerawpointer/+=(_:_:).md)
- [static func - (Self, Self) -> Self.Stride](unsafemutablerawpointer/-(_:_:)-2mzz6.md)
- [static func - (Self, Self.Stride) -> Self](unsafemutablerawpointer/-(_:_:)-7vabq.md)
- [static func -= (inout Self, Self.Stride)](unsafemutablerawpointer/-=(_:_:).md)
### Instance Methods
- [func advanced(by: Int) -> UnsafeMutableRawPointer](unsafemutablerawpointer/advanced(by:).md)
  Returns a value that is offset the specified distance from this value.
### Type Aliases
- [UnsafeMutableRawPointer.Stride](unsafemutablerawpointer/stride.md)
  A type that represents the distance between two values.
