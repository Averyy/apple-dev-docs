## Topics

### Instance Methods
- [func allSatisfy((Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool](asyncfiltersequence/allsatisfy(_:).md)
  Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether all elements produced by the asynchronous sequence satisfy the given predicate.
- [func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) async -> ElementOfResult?) -> AsyncCompactMapSequence<Self, ElementOfResult>](asyncfiltersequence/compactmap(_:)-1ux9n.md)
  Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.
- [func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) async throws -> ElementOfResult?) -> AsyncThrowingCompactMapSequence<Self, ElementOfResult>](asyncfiltersequence/compactmap(_:)-670wo.md)
  Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps an error-throwing closure over the base sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.

- [func map<Transformed>((Self.Element) async throws -> Transformed) -> AsyncThrowingMapSequence<Self, Transformed>](asyncfiltersequence/map(_:)-9wvb.md)
  Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given error-throwing closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.
- [func map<Transformed>((Self.Element) async -> Transformed) -> AsyncMapSequence<Self, Transformed>](asyncfiltersequence/map(_:)-ljd0.md)
  Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.
- [func max() async rethrows -> Self.Element?](asyncfiltersequence/max.md)

- [func prefix(Int) -> AsyncPrefixSequence<Self>](asyncfiltersequence/prefix(_:).md)
  Returns an asynchronous sequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the base asynchronous sequence.
- [func prefix(while: (Self.Element) async -> Bool) rethrows -> AsyncPrefixWhileSequence<Self>](asyncfiltersequence/prefix(while:).md)
  Returns an asynchronous sequence, containing the initial, consecutive elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.
- [func reduce<Result>(Result, (Result, Self.Element) async throws -> Result) async rethrows -> Result](asyncfiltersequence/reduce(_:_:).md)
  Returns the result of combining the elements of the asynchronous sequence using the given closure.
