### Operators
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeThrough<Self>](suspendingclock/instant/'...(_:)-79vop.md)
  Returns a partial range up to, and including, its upper bound.
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeFrom<Self>](suspendingclock/instant/'...(_:)-9qpet.md)
  Returns a partial range extending upward from a lower bound.
- [static func ... (Self, Self) -> ClosedRange<Self>](suspendingclock/instant/'...(_:_:).md)
  Returns a closed range that contains both of its bounds.
- [static func ..< (Self) -> PartialRangeUpTo<Self>](suspendingclock/instant/'.._(_:).md)
  Returns a partial range up to, but not including, its upper bound.
- [static func ..< (Self, Self) -> Range<Self>](suspendingclock/instant/'.._(_:_:).md)
  Returns a half-open range that contains its lower bound but not its upper bound.
- [static func < (SuspendingClock.Instant, SuspendingClock.Instant) -> Bool](suspendingclock/instant/_(_:_:).md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than that of the second argument.
- [static func > (Self, Self) -> Bool](suspendingclock/instant/_(_:_:)-877n2.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (Self, Self) -> Bool](suspendingclock/instant/_=(_:_:)-4o9y7.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func <= (Self, Self) -> Bool](suspendingclock/instant/_=(_:_:)-897gt.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
