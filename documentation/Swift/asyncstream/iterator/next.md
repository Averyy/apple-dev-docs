```

#### Discussion

When `next()` returns `nil`, this signifies the end of the `AsyncStream`.

It is a programmer error to invoke `next()` from a concurrent context that contends with another such call, which results in a call to `fatalError()`.

If you cancel the task this iterator is running in while `next()` is awaiting a value, the `AsyncStream` terminates. In this case, `next()` might return `nil` immediately, or return `nil` on subsequent calls.
