- [struct RegexRepetitionBehavior](regexrepetitionbehavior.md)
  Specifies how much to attempt to match when using a quantifier.
- [struct RegexSemanticLevel](regexsemanticlevel.md)
  A semantic level to use during regex matching.
- [struct RegexWordBoundaryKind](regexwordboundarykind.md)
  A word boundary algorithm to use during regex matching.
- [struct AnyRegexOutput](anyregexoutput.md)
  The type-erased, dynamic output of a regular expression match.
- [protocol RegexComponent](regexcomponent.md)
  A type that represents a regular expression.
- [protocol CustomConsumingRegexComponent](customconsumingregexcomponent.md)
### Encoding and Storage
- [enum Unicode](unicode.md)
