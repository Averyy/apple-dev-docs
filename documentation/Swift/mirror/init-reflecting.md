## Declaration

```swift
init(reflecting subject: Any)
```

#### Discussion

If the dynamic type of `subject` conforms to `CustomReflectable`, the resulting mirror is determined by its `customMirror` property. Otherwise, the result is generated by the language.

If the dynamic type of `subject` has value semantics, subsequent mutations of `subject` will not observable in `Mirror`.  In general, though, the observability of mutations is unspecified.

## Parameters

- `subject`: The instance for which to create a mirror.
