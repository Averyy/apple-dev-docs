## Topics

### Operators
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeThrough<Self>](int/'...(_:)-4mm5u.md)
  Returns a partial range up to, and including, its upper bound.
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeFrom<Self>](int/'...(_:)-6ct66.md)
  Returns a partial range extending upward from a lower bound.
- [static func ... (Self, Self) -> ClosedRange<Self>](int/'...(_:_:).md)
  Returns a closed range that contains both of its bounds.
- [static func ..< (Self) -> PartialRangeUpTo<Self>](int/'.._(_:).md)
  Returns a partial range up to, but not including, its upper bound.
- [static func ..< (Self, Self) -> Range<Self>](int/'.._(_:_:).md)
  Returns a half-open range that contains its lower bound but not its upper bound.
- [static func > (Self, Self) -> Bool](int/_(_:_:)-24u4v.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func > (Int, Int) -> Bool](int/_(_:_:)-9cdiy.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func < (Self, Self) -> Bool](int/_(_:_:)-fe4g.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than that of the second argument.
- [static func <= (Self, Self) -> Bool](int/_=(_:_:)-1ii8.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func <= (Int, Int) -> Bool](int/_=(_:_:)-28qlv.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (Int, Int) -> Bool](int/_=(_:_:)-443dp.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (Self, Self) -> Bool](int/_=(_:_:)-8lyh0.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
