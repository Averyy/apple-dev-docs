#### Discussion

Use a multicast publisher when you have multiple downstream subscribers, but you want upstream publishers to only process one `Subscriber/receive(_:)` call per event. This is useful when upstream publishers are doing expensive work you don’t want to duplicate, like performing network requests.

In contrast with [`multicast(subject:)`](optional/publisher-swift.struct/multicast(subject:).md), this method produces a publisher that creates a separate `Subject` for each subscriber.

The following example uses a sequence publisher as a counter to publish three random numbers, generated by a `Publisher/map(_:)-99evh` operator. It uses a [`multicast(_:)`](optional/publisher-swift.struct/multicast(_:).md) operator whose closure creates a `PassthroughSubject` to share the same random number to each of two subscribers. Because the multicast publisher is a `ConnectablePublisher`, publishing only begins after a call to `ConnectablePublisher/connect()`.

```swift
let pub = ["First", "Second", "Third"].publisher
    .map( { return ($0, Int.random(in: 0...100)) } )
    .print("Random")
    .multicast { PassthroughSubject<(String, Int), Never>() }

cancellable1 = pub
   .sink { print ("Stream 1 received: \($0)")}
cancellable2 = pub
   .sink { print ("Stream 2 received: \($0)")}
pub.connect()

// Prints:
// Random: receive value: (("First", 9))
// Stream 2 received: ("First", 9)
// Stream 1 received: ("First", 9)
// Random: receive value: (("Second", 46))
// Stream 2 received: ("Second", 46)
// Stream 1 received: ("Second", 46)
// Random: receive value: (("Third", 26))
// Stream 2 received: ("Third", 26)
// Stream 1 received: ("Third", 26)
```

In this example, the output shows that the [`print(_:to:)`](optional/publisher-swift.struct/print(_:to:).md) operator receives each random value only one time, and then sends the value to both subscribers.

## Parameters

- `createSubject`: A closure to create a new   each time a subscriber attaches to the multicast publisher.
