# intersection(_:)

**Framework**: Swift  
**Kind**: method

Returns a new set with the elements that are common to both this set and the given sequence.

## Declaration

```swift
func intersection(_ other: Set<Element>) -> Set<Element>
```

#### Return Value

A new set.

#### Discussion

In the following example, the `bothNeighborsAndEmployees` set is made up of the elements that are in  the `employees` and `neighbors` sets. Elements that are in only one or the other are left out of the result of the intersection.

```swift
let employees: Set = ["Alicia", "Bethany", "Chris", "Diana", "Eric"]
let neighbors: Set = ["Bethany", "Eric", "Forlani", "Greta"]
let bothNeighborsAndEmployees = employees.intersection(neighbors)
print(bothNeighborsAndEmployees)
// Prints "["Bethany", "Eric"]"
```

## Parameters

- `other`: Another set.
