### Operators
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeThrough<Self>](set/index/'...(_:)-30fi7.md)
  Returns a partial range up to, and including, its upper bound.
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeFrom<Self>](set/index/'...(_:)-61uj4.md)
  Returns a partial range extending upward from a lower bound.
- [static func ... (Self, Self) -> ClosedRange<Self>](set/index/'...(_:_:).md)
  Returns a closed range that contains both of its bounds.
- [static func ..< (Self) -> PartialRangeUpTo<Self>](set/index/'.._(_:).md)
  Returns a partial range up to, but not including, its upper bound.
- [static func ..< (Self, Self) -> Range<Self>](set/index/'.._(_:_:).md)
  Returns a half-open range that contains its lower bound but not its upper bound.
- [static func < (Set<Element>.Index, Set<Element>.Index) -> Bool](set/index/_(_:_:).md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than that of the second argument.
- [static func > (Self, Self) -> Bool](set/index/_(_:_:)-8taor.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (Self, Self) -> Bool](set/index/_=(_:_:)-8cq0s.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func <= (Self, Self) -> Bool](set/index/_=(_:_:)-9wsxs.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
