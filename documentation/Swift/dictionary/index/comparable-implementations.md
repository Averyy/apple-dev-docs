### Operators
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeThrough<Self>](dictionary/index/'...(_:)-4p0eq.md)
  Returns a partial range up to, and including, its upper bound.
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeFrom<Self>](dictionary/index/'...(_:)-6z81l.md)
  Returns a partial range extending upward from a lower bound.
- [static func ... (Self, Self) -> ClosedRange<Self>](dictionary/index/'...(_:_:).md)
  Returns a closed range that contains both of its bounds.
- [static func ..< (Self) -> PartialRangeUpTo<Self>](dictionary/index/'.._(_:).md)
  Returns a partial range up to, but not including, its upper bound.
- [static func ..< (Self, Self) -> Range<Self>](dictionary/index/'.._(_:_:).md)
  Returns a half-open range that contains its lower bound but not its upper bound.
- [static func < (Dictionary<Key, Value>.Index, Dictionary<Key, Value>.Index) -> Bool](dictionary/index/_(_:_:).md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than that of the second argument.
- [static func > (Self, Self) -> Bool](dictionary/index/_(_:_:)-7cwwa.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func <= (Self, Self) -> Bool](dictionary/index/_=(_:_:)-2svy0.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (Self, Self) -> Bool](dictionary/index/_=(_:_:)-6o53l.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
