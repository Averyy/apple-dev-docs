## Declaration

```swift
func shuffled() -> [Self.Element]
```

#### Return Value

A shuffled array of this sequence’s elements.

#### Discussion

For example, you can shuffle the numbers between `0` and `9` by calling the `shuffled()` method on that range:

```swift
let numbers = 0...9
let shuffledNumbers = numbers.shuffled()
// shuffledNumbers == [1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 9, 4, 3, 5, 0]
```

This method is equivalent to calling `shuffled(using:)`, passing in the system’s default random generator.

> **Note**: O(), where  is the length of the sequence.

O(), where  is the length of the sequence.
