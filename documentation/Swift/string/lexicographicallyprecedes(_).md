# lexicographicallyPrecedes(_:)

**Framework**: Swift  
**Kind**: method  
**Role**: Instance Method

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the less-than operator (`<`) to compare elements.

**Availability**:
- iOS 8.0+
- iPadOS 8.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.0+
- macOS 10.10+
- tvOS 9.0+
- visionOS 1.0+
- watchOS 2.0+

## Declaration

```swift
func lexicographicallyPrecedes<OtherSequence>(_ other: OtherSequence) -> Bool where OtherSequence : Sequence, Self.Element == OtherSequence.Element
```

Available when `Element` conforms to `Comparable`.

## Return Value

`true` if this sequence precedes `other` in a dictionary ordering; otherwise, `false`.

## Discussion

This example uses the `lexicographicallyPrecedes` method to test which array of integers comes first in a lexicographical ordering.

```swift
let a = [1, 2, 2, 2]
let b = [1, 2, 3, 4]

print(a.lexicographicallyPrecedes(b))
// Prints "true"
print(b.lexicographicallyPrecedes(b))
// Prints "false"
```

> **Note**: This method implements the mathematical notion of lexicographical ordering, which has no connection to Unicode.  If you are sorting strings to present to the end user, use `String` APIs that perform localized comparison.

> **Complexity**: O(*m*), where *m* is the lesser of the length of the sequence and the length of `other`.

## Parameters

- `other`: A sequence to compare to this sequence.

### Comparing Characters
- [func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence) -> Bool](./elementsequal%28_%29.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain the same elements in the same order.
- [func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (Self.Element, OtherSequence.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool](./elementsequal%28_,by%29.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain equivalent elements in the same order, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.
- [func starts<PossiblePrefix>(with: PossiblePrefix) -> Bool](./starts%28with%29.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are the same as the elements in another sequence.
- [func starts<PossiblePrefix>(with: PossiblePrefix, by: (Self.Element, PossiblePrefix.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool](./starts%28with,by%29.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the initial elements of the sequence are equivalent to the elements in another sequence, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.
- [func lexicographicallyPrecedes<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool](./lexicographicallyprecedes%28_,by%29.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the given predicate to compare elements.
