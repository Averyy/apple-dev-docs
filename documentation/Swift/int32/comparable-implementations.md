### Operators
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeFrom<Self>](int32/'...(_:)-33g6y.md)
  Returns a partial range extending upward from a lower bound.
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeThrough<Self>](int32/'...(_:)-67bt7.md)
  Returns a partial range up to, and including, its upper bound.
- [static func ... (Self, Self) -> ClosedRange<Self>](int32/'...(_:_:).md)
  Returns a closed range that contains both of its bounds.
- [static func ..< (Self) -> PartialRangeUpTo<Self>](int32/'.._(_:).md)
  Returns a partial range up to, but not including, its upper bound.
- [static func ..< (Self, Self) -> Range<Self>](int32/'.._(_:_:).md)
  Returns a half-open range that contains its lower bound but not its upper bound.
- [static func > (Self, Self) -> Bool](int32/_(_:_:)-30znw.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func < (Self, Self) -> Bool](int32/_(_:_:)-4d2t4.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than that of the second argument.
- [static func > (Int32, Int32) -> Bool](int32/_(_:_:)-5p8ms.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (Int32, Int32) -> Bool](int32/_=(_:_:)-1ukxu.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (Self, Self) -> Bool](int32/_=(_:_:)-4n6ly.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func <= (Int32, Int32) -> Bool](int32/_=(_:_:)-5corj.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func <= (Self, Self) -> Bool](int32/_=(_:_:)-658lf.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
