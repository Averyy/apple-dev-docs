## Topics

### Operators
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeThrough<Self>](uint/'...(_:)-4mm5q.md)
  Returns a partial range up to, and including, its upper bound.
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeFrom<Self>](uint/'...(_:)-6ct6a.md)
  Returns a partial range extending upward from a lower bound.
- [static func ... (Self, Self) -> ClosedRange<Self>](uint/'...(_:_:).md)
  Returns a closed range that contains both of its bounds.
- [static func ..< (Self) -> PartialRangeUpTo<Self>](uint/'.._(_:).md)
  Returns a partial range up to, but not including, its upper bound.
- [static func ..< (Self, Self) -> Range<Self>](uint/'.._(_:_:).md)
  Returns a half-open range that contains its lower bound but not its upper bound.
- [static func > (Self, Self) -> Bool](uint/_(_:_:)-24u4z.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func > (UInt, UInt) -> Bool](uint/_(_:_:)-4iyb6.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func < (Self, Self) -> Bool](uint/_(_:_:)-fe58.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than that of the second argument.
- [static func <= (Self, Self) -> Bool](uint/_=(_:_:)-1ii4.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func <= (UInt, UInt) -> Bool](uint/_=(_:_:)-5txp.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (Self, Self) -> Bool](uint/_=(_:_:)-8lyhk.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (UInt, UInt) -> Bool](uint/_=(_:_:)-9x0o8.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
