**Framework**: Swift  
**Kind**: method

## Declaration

```swift
func first(where predicate: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?
```

#### Return Value

The first element of the sequence that satisfies `predicate`, or `nil` if there is no element that satisfies `predicate`.

#### Discussion

The following example uses the `first(where:)` method to find the first negative number in an array of integers:

```swift
let numbers = [3, 7, 4, -2, 9, -6, 10, 1]
if let firstNegative = numbers.first(where: { $0 < 0 }) {
    print("The first negative number is \(firstNegative).")
}
// Prints "The first negative number is -2."
```

> **Note**: O(), where  is the length of the sequence.

## Parameters

- `predicate`: A closure that takes an element of the sequence as   its argument and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the   element is a match.
