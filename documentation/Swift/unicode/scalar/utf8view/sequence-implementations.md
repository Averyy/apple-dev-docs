### Instance Properties
- [var lazy: LazySequence<Self>](./lazy.md)
  A sequence containing the same elements as this sequence, but on which some operations, such as `map` and `filter`, are implemented lazily.
### Instance Methods

  Returns an array containing the non-`nil` results of calling the given transformation with each element of this sequence.
- [func contains(Self.Element) -> Bool](./contains%28_%29.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence contains the given element.
- [func contains(where: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool](./contains%28where%29.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence contains an element that satisfies the given predicate.
- [func count<E>(where: (Self.Element) throws(E) -> Bool) throws(E) -> Int](./count%28where%29.md)
  Returns the number of elements in the sequence that satisfy the given predicate.

- [func elementsEqual<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (Self.Element, OtherSequence.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool](./elementsequal%28_,by%29.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether this sequence and another sequence contain equivalent elements in the same order, using the given predicate as the equivalence test.
- [func enumerated() -> EnumeratedSequence<Self>](./enumerated%28%29.md)
  Returns a sequence of pairs (*n*, *x*), where *n* represents a consecutive integer starting at zero and *x* represents an element of the sequence.
- [func filter<E>((Self.Element) throws(E) -> Bool) throws(E) -> [Self.Element]](./filter%28_%29.md)
  Returns an array containing, in order, the elements of the sequence that satisfy the given predicate.

- [func lexicographicallyPrecedes<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence) -> Bool](./lexicographicallyprecedes%28_%29.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the less-than operator (`<`) to compare elements.
- [func lexicographicallyPrecedes<OtherSequence>(OtherSequence, by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Bool](./lexicographicallyprecedes%28_,by%29.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the sequence precedes another sequence in a lexicographical (dictionary) ordering, using the given predicate to compare elements.
- [func map<T, E>((Self.Element) throws(E) -> T) throws(E) -> [T]](./map%28_%29-7dggx.md)
  Returns an array containing the results of mapping the given closure over the sequence’s elements.
- [func max() -> Self.Element?](./max%28%29.md)
  Returns the maximum element in the sequence.
- [func max(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> Self.Element?](./max%28by%29.md)

  Returns the result of combining the elements of the sequence using the given closure.
- [func reduce<Result>(into: Result, (inout Result, Self.Element) throws -> ()) rethrows -> Result](./reduce%28into,_%29.md)
  Returns the result of combining the elements of the sequence using the given closure.
- [func shuffled() -> [Self.Element]](./shuffled%28%29.md)
  Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled.
- [func shuffled<T>(using: inout T) -> [Self.Element]](./shuffled%28using%29.md)
  Returns the elements of the sequence, shuffled using the given generator as a source for randomness.
- [func sorted() -> [Self.Element]](./sorted%28%29.md)
  Returns the elements of the sequence, sorted.
- [func sorted(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [Self.Element]](./sorted%28by%29.md)
