# Operator Declarations

**Framework**: Swift

Work with prefix, postfix, and infix operators.

#### Overview

The tables below list the operators declared by the Swift standard library. For more information about operation declarations, see [`Operator Declaration`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/declarations/#Operator-Declaration) in [`The Swift Programming Language`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://docs.swift.org/swift-book/).

The prefix operators are as follows:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `!` | Logical NOT |
| `.!` | Pointwise logical NOT |
| `~` | Bitwise NOT |
| `+` | Unary plus |
| `-` | Unary minus |
| `..<` | Half-open range |
| `...` | Closed range |

The postfix operators are as follows:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `...` | Range |

The infix operators are grouped below by precedence group in decreasing order of precedence. If you declare a new operator without specifying a precedence group, it is a member of the `DefaultPrecedence` precedence group. `DefaultPrecedence` has no associativity and a precedence immediately higher than `TernaryPrecedence`.

The `BitwiseShiftPrecedence` group, which isn’t associative, contains the following infix operators:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<<` | Bitwise left shift |
| `>>` | Bitwise right shift |
| `&<<` | Bitwise left shift, ignoring overflow |
| `&>>` | Bitwise right shift, ignoring overflow |

The `MultiplicationPrecedence` group, which is left associative, contains the following infix operators:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `*` | Multiply |
| `/` | Divide |
| `%` | Remainder |
| `&` | Bitwise AND |
| `&*` | Multiply with overflow |

The `AdditionPrecedence` group, which is left associative, contains the following infix operators:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `+` | Add |
| `-` | Subtract |
| `|` | Bitwise OR |
| `^` | Bitwise XOR |
| `&+` | Add with overflow |
| `&-` | Subtract with overflow |

The `RangeFormationPrecedence` group, which isn’t associative, contains the following infix operators:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `..<` | Half-open range |
| `...` | Closed range |

The `CastingPrecedence` group, which is left associative, contains the following infix operators:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `is` | Type check |
| `as`, `as?`, and `as!` | Type cast |

The `NilCoalescingPrecedence` group, which is right associative, contains the following infix operators:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `??` | Nil coalescing |

The `ComparisonPrecedence` group, which isn’t associative, contains the following infix operators:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `<` | Less than |
| `<=` | Less than or equal |
| `>` | Greater than |
| `>=` | Greater than or equal |
| `==` | Equal |
| `!=` | Not equal |
| `===` | Identical |
| `!==` | Not identical |
| `~=` | Pattern match |
| `.<` | Pointwise less than |
| `.<=` | Pointwise less than or equal |
| `.>` | Pointwise greater than |
| `.>=` | Pointwise greater than or equal |
| `.==` | Pointwise equal |
| `.!=` | Pointwise not equal |

The `LogicalConjunctionPrecedence` group, which is left associative, contains the following infix operators:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `&&` | Logical AND |
| `.&` | Pointwise bitwise AND |

The `LogicalDisjunctionPrecedence` group, which is left associative, contains the following infix operators:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `||` | Logical OR |
| `.|` | Pointwise bitwise OR |
| `.^` | Pointwise bitwise XOR |

The `TernaryPrecedence` group, which is right associative, contains the following infix operators:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `?` `:` | Ternary conditional |

The `AssignmentPrecedence` group, which is right associative, contain the following infix operators:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `=` | Assign |
| `*=` | Multiply and assign |
| `/=` | Divide and assign |
| `%=` | Remainder and assign |
| `+=` | Add and assign |
| `-=` | Subtract and assign |
| `<<=` | Left bit shift and assign |
| `>>=` | Right bit shift and assign |
| `&=` | Bitwise AND and assign |
| `|=` | Bitwise OR and assign |
| `^=` | Bitwise XOR and assign |
| `&*=` | Multiply with overflow and assign |
| `&+=` | Add with overflow and assign |
| `&-=` | Subtract with overflow and assign |
| `&<<=` | Left bit shift ignoring overflow and assign |
| `&>>=` | Right bit shift ignoring overflow and assign |
| `.&=` | Pointwise bitwise AND and assign |
| `.|=` | Pointwise bitwise OR and assign |
| `.^=` | Pointwise bitwise XOR and assign |
