### Operators
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeThrough<Self>](closedrange/index/'...(_:)-5e4wo.md)
  Returns a partial range up to, and including, its upper bound.
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeFrom<Self>](closedrange/index/'...(_:)-63ber.md)
  Returns a partial range extending upward from a lower bound.
- [static func ... (Self, Self) -> ClosedRange<Self>](closedrange/index/'...(_:_:).md)
  Returns a closed range that contains both of its bounds.
- [static func ..< (Self) -> PartialRangeUpTo<Self>](closedrange/index/'.._(_:).md)
  Returns a partial range up to, but not including, its upper bound.
- [static func ..< (Self, Self) -> Range<Self>](closedrange/index/'.._(_:_:).md)
  Returns a half-open range that contains its lower bound but not its upper bound.
- [static func < (ClosedRange<Bound>.Index, ClosedRange<Bound>.Index) -> Bool](closedrange/index/_(_:_:).md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than that of the second argument.
- [static func > (Self, Self) -> Bool](closedrange/index/_(_:_:)-1fc79.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (Self, Self) -> Bool](closedrange/index/_=(_:_:)-52920.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func <= (Self, Self) -> Bool](closedrange/index/_=(_:_:)-divd.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
