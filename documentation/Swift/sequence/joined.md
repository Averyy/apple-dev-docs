## Declaration

```swift
func joined() -> FlattenSequence<Self>
```

#### Return Value

A flattened view of the elements of this sequence of sequences.

#### Discussion

In this example, an array of three ranges is flattened so that the elements of each range can be iterated in turn.

```swift
let ranges = [0..<3, 8..<10, 15..<17]

// A for-in loop over 'ranges' accesses each range:
for range in ranges {
  print(range)
}
// Prints "0..<3"
// Prints "8..<10"
// Prints "15..<17"

// Use 'joined()' to access each element of each range:
for index in ranges.joined() {
    print(index, terminator: " ")
}
// Prints: "0 1 2 8 9 15 16"
```

- [func split(maxSplits: Int, omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool, whereSeparator: (Self.Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [ArraySlice<Self.Element>]](sequence/split(maxsplits:omittingemptysubsequences:whereseparator:).md)
  Returns the longest possible subsequences of the sequence, in order, that don’t contain elements satisfying the given predicate. Elements that are used to split the sequence are not returned as part of any subsequence.
- [func split(separator: Self.Element, maxSplits: Int, omittingEmptySubsequences: Bool) -> [ArraySlice<Self.Element>]](sequence/split(separator:maxsplits:omittingemptysubsequences:).md)
  Returns the longest possible subsequences of the sequence, in order, around elements equal to the given element.
- [func joined(separator: String) -> String](sequence/joined(separator:)-5zjyj.md)
  Returns a new string by concatenating the elements of the sequence, adding the given separator between each element.
- [func joined<Separator>(separator: Separator) -> JoinedSequence<Self>](sequence/joined(separator:)-7w47r.md)
  Returns the concatenated elements of this sequence of sequences, inserting the given separator between each element.
