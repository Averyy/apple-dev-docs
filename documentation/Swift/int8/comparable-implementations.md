### Operators
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeThrough<Self>](int8/'...(_:)-4f0gs.md)
  Returns a partial range up to, and including, its upper bound.
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeFrom<Self>](int8/'...(_:)-4tgui.md)
  Returns a partial range extending upward from a lower bound.
- [static func ... (Self, Self) -> ClosedRange<Self>](int8/'...(_:_:).md)
  Returns a closed range that contains both of its bounds.
- [static func ..< (Self) -> PartialRangeUpTo<Self>](int8/'.._(_:).md)
  Returns a partial range up to, but not including, its upper bound.
- [static func ..< (Self, Self) -> Range<Self>](int8/'.._(_:_:).md)
  Returns a half-open range that contains its lower bound but not its upper bound.
- [static func < (Self, Self) -> Bool](int8/_(_:_:)-14f22.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than that of the second argument.
- [static func > (Self, Self) -> Bool](int8/_(_:_:)-1r3uj.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func > (Int8, Int8) -> Bool](int8/_(_:_:)-59kbk.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func <= (Self, Self) -> Bool](int8/_=(_:_:)-2nsgl.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func <= (Int8, Int8) -> Bool](int8/_=(_:_:)-7pwh6.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (Int8, Int8) -> Bool](int8/_=(_:_:)-863du.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (Self, Self) -> Bool](int8/_=(_:_:)-qbgp.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
