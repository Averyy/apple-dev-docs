# Strideable Implementations

**Framework**: Swift

## Topics

### Operators
- [static func + (Self, Self.Stride) -> Self](unsafepointer/+(_:_:)-5q1dp.md)
- [static func + (Self.Stride, Self) -> Self](unsafepointer/+(_:_:)-7xyjl.md)
- [static func += (inout Self, Self.Stride)](unsafepointer/+=(_:_:).md)
- [static func - (Self, Self) -> Self.Stride](unsafepointer/-(_:_:)-2mzyc.md)
- [static func - (Self, Self.Stride) -> Self](unsafepointer/-(_:_:)-7vacg.md)
- [static func -= (inout Self, Self.Stride)](unsafepointer/-=(_:_:).md)
### Type Aliases
- [UnsafePointer.Stride](unsafepointer/stride.md)
  A type that represents the distance between two values.
