**Framework**: Swift  
**Kind**: method

Shuffles the collection in place, using the given generator as a source for randomness.

## Declaration

```swift
mutating func shuffle<T>(using generator: inout T) where T : RandomNumberGenerator
```

#### Discussion

You use this method to randomize the elements of a collection when you are using a custom random number generator. For example, you can use the `shuffle(using:)` method to randomly reorder the elements of an array.

```swift
var names = ["Alejandro", "Camila", "Diego", "Luciana", "Luis", "Sofía"]
names.shuffle(using: &myGenerator)
// names == ["Sofía", "Alejandro", "Camila", "Luis", "Diego", "Luciana"]
```

> **Note**: O(), where  is the length of the collection.

> **Note**: The algorithm used to shuffle a collection may change in a future version of Swift. If you’re passing a generator that results in the same shuffled order each time you run your program, that sequence may change when your program is compiled using a different version of Swift.

## Parameters

- `generator`: The random number generator to use when shuffling   the collection.
