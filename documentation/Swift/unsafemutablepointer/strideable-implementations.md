**Framework**: Swift

## Topics

### Operators
- [static func + (Self, Self.Stride) -> Self](unsafemutablepointer/+(_:_:)-5q1ct.md)
- [static func + (Self.Stride, Self) -> Self](unsafemutablepointer/+(_:_:)-7xyip.md)
- [static func += (inout Self, Self.Stride)](unsafemutablepointer/+=(_:_:).md)
- [static func - (Self, Self) -> Self.Stride](unsafemutablepointer/-(_:_:)-2mzz8.md)
- [static func - (Self, Self.Stride) -> Self](unsafemutablepointer/-(_:_:)-7vabk.md)
- [static func -= (inout Self, Self.Stride)](unsafemutablepointer/-=(_:_:).md)
### Type Aliases
- [UnsafeMutablePointer.Stride](unsafemutablepointer/stride.md)
  A type that represents the distance between two values.
