# detached(executorPreference:priority:operation:)

**Framework**: Swift  
**Kind**: method

Runs the given throwing operation asynchronously as part of a new top-level task.

- iOS 18.0+
- iPadOS 18.0+
- Mac Catalyst 18.0+
- macOS 15.0+
- tvOS 18.0+
- visionOS 2.0+
- watchOS 11.0+

## Declaration

```swift
@discardableResult
static func detached(executorPreference taskExecutor: (any TaskExecutor)?, priority: TaskPriority? = nil, operation: sending @escaping () async throws -> Success) -> Task<Success, Failure>
```

#### Return Value

A reference to the newly created task.

#### Discussion

If the operation throws an error, this method propagates that error.

Don’t use a detached task if it’s possible to model the operation using structured concurrency features like child tasks. Child tasks inherit the parent task’s priority and task-local storage, and canceling a parent task automatically cancels all of its child tasks. You need to handle these considerations manually with a detached task.

You need to keep a reference to the detached task if you want to cancel it by calling the `Task.cancel()` method. Discarding your reference to a detached task doesn’t implicitly cancel that task, it only makes it impossible for you to explicitly cancel the task.

> **Note**: `withTaskExecutorPreference(_:operation:)`

`withTaskExecutorPreference(_:operation:)`

## Parameters

- `taskExecutor`: The preferred task executor for this task,   and any child tasks created by it. Explicitly passing   is   interpreted as “no preference”.
- `priority`: The priority of the task.   Pass   to use the priority from  .
- `operation`: The operation to perform.
