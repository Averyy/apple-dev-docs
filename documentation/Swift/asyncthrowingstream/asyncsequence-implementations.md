## Topics

### Instance Methods
- [func allSatisfy((Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Bool](asyncthrowingstream/allsatisfy(_:).md)
  Returns a Boolean value that indicates whether all elements produced by the asynchronous sequence satisfy the given predicate.
- [func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) async -> ElementOfResult?) -> AsyncCompactMapSequence<Self, ElementOfResult>](asyncthrowingstream/compactmap(_:)-7mgih.md)
  Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.
- [func compactMap<ElementOfResult>((Self.Element) async throws -> ElementOfResult?) -> AsyncThrowingCompactMapSequence<Self, ElementOfResult>](asyncthrowingstream/compactmap(_:)-944nt.md)
  Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps an error-throwing closure over the base sequence’s elements, omitting results that don’t return a value.

- [func makeAsyncIterator() -> AsyncThrowingStream<Element, Failure>.Iterator](asyncthrowingstream/makeasynciterator.md)
  Creates the asynchronous iterator that produces elements of this asynchronous sequence.
- [func map<Transformed>((Self.Element) async -> Transformed) -> AsyncMapSequence<Self, Transformed>](asyncthrowingstream/map(_:)-4a4ke.md)
  Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.
- [func map<Transformed>((Self.Element) async throws -> Transformed) -> AsyncThrowingMapSequence<Self, Transformed>](asyncthrowingstream/map(_:)-58nrj.md)
  Creates an asynchronous sequence that maps the given error-throwing closure over the asynchronous sequence’s elements.
- [func max() async rethrows -> Self.Element?](asyncthrowingstream/max.md)
  Returns the maximum element in an asynchronous sequence of comparable elements.
- [func max(by: (Self.Element, Self.Element) async throws -> Bool) async rethrows -> Self.Element?](asyncthrowingstream/max(by:).md)
  Returns the maximum element in the asynchronous sequence, using the given predicate as the comparison between elements.
- [func min() async rethrows -> Self.Element?](asyncthrowingstream/min.md)

- [func prefix(Int) -> AsyncPrefixSequence<Self>](asyncthrowingstream/prefix(_:).md)
  Returns an asynchronous sequence, up to the specified maximum length, containing the initial elements of the base asynchronous sequence.
- [func prefix(while: (Self.Element) async -> Bool) rethrows -> AsyncPrefixWhileSequence<Self>](asyncthrowingstream/prefix(while:).md)
  Returns an asynchronous sequence, containing the initial, consecutive elements of the base sequence that satisfy the given predicate.
- [func reduce<Result>(Result, (Result, Self.Element) async throws -> Result) async rethrows -> Result](asyncthrowingstream/reduce(_:_:).md)
  Returns the result of combining the elements of the asynchronous sequence using the given closure.
