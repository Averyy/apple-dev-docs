# formIndex(_:offsetBy:limitedBy:)

**Framework**: Swift  
**Kind**: method

Offsets the given index by the specified distance, or so that it equals the given limiting index.

## Declaration

```swift
func formIndex(_ i: inout Self.Index, offsetBy distance: Int, limitedBy limit: Self.Index) -> Bool
```

#### Return Value

`true` if `i` has been offset by exactly `distance` steps without going beyond `limit`; otherwise, `false`. When the return value is `false`, the value of `i` is equal to `limit`.

#### Discussion

The value passed as `distance` must not offset `i` beyond the bounds of the collection, unless the index passed as `limit` prevents offsetting beyond those bounds.

> **Note**: O(1) if the collection conforms to `RandomAccessCollection`; otherwise, O(), where  is the absolute value of `distance`.

## Parameters

- `i`: A valid index of the collection.
- `distance`: The distance to offset  .   must not be negative   unless the collection conforms to the    protocol.
- `limit`: A valid index of the collection to use as a limit. If   , a limit that is less than   has no effect.   Likewise, if  , a limit that is greater than   has no   effect.
