# Key-Path Expressions

**Framework**: Swift

Use key-path expressions to access properties dynamically.

## Topics

### Key Paths
- [class KeyPath](keypath.md)
  A key path from a specific root type to a specific resulting value type.
- [class PartialKeyPath](partialkeypath.md)
  A partially type-erased key path, from a concrete root type to any resulting value type.
- [class AnyKeyPath](anykeypath.md)
  A type-erased key path, from any root type to any resulting value type.
### Writable Key Paths
- [class WritableKeyPath](writablekeypath.md)
  A key path that supports reading from and writing to the resulting value.
- [class ReferenceWritableKeyPath](referencewritablekeypath.md)
  A key path that supports reading from and writing to the resulting value with reference semantics.
