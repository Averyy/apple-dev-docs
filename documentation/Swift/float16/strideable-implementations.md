### Instance Methods
- [func advanced(by: Float16) -> Float16](float16/advanced(by:).md)
  Returns a value that is offset the specified distance from this value.
- [func distance(to: Float16) -> Float16](float16/distance(to:).md)
  Returns the distance from this value to the given value, expressed as a stride.
### Type Aliases
- [typealias Stride](float16/stride.md)
