# index(_:offsetBy:)

**Framework**: Swift  
**Kind**: method  
**Required**: Yes

Returns an index that is the specified distance from the given index.

**Availability**:
- iOS 8.0+
- iPadOS 8.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.0+
- macOS 10.10+
- tvOS 9.0+

## Declaration

```swift
func index(_ i: Self.Index, offsetBy distance: Int) -> Self.Index
```

#### Return Value

An index offset by `distance` from the index `i`. If `distance` is positive, this is the same value as the result of `distance` calls to `index(after:)`. If `distance` is negative, this is the same value as the result of `abs(distance)` calls to `index(before:)`.

#### Discussion

The following example obtains an index advanced four positions from a string’s starting index and then prints the character at that position.

```swift
let s = "Swift"
let i = s.index(s.startIndex, offsetBy: 4)
print(s[i])
// Prints "t"
```

The value passed as `distance` must not offset `i` beyond the bounds of the collection.

> **Note**: O(1) if the collection conforms to `RandomAccessCollection`; otherwise, O(), where  is the absolute value of `distance`.

## Parameters

- `i`: A valid index of the collection.
- `distance`: The distance to offset  .   must not be negative   unless the collection conforms to the    protocol.
