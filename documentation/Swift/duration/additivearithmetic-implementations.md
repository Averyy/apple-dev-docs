# AdditiveArithmetic Implementations

**Framework**: Swift

## Topics

### Operators
- [static func + (Self) -> Self](duration/+(_:).md)
  Returns the given number unchanged.
- [static func + (Duration, Duration) -> Duration](duration/+(_:_:).md)
  Adds two values and produces their sum.
- [static func += (inout Duration, Duration)](duration/+=(_:_:).md)
  Adds two values and stores the result in the left-hand-side variable.
- [static func += (inout Self, Self)](duration/+=(_:_:)-4dm12.md)
  Adds two values and stores the result in the left-hand-side variable.
- [static func - (Duration, Duration) -> Duration](duration/-(_:_:).md)
  Subtracts one value from another and produces their difference.
- [static func -= (inout Duration, Duration)](duration/-=(_:_:).md)
  Subtracts the second value from the first and stores the difference in the left-hand-side variable.
- [static func -= (inout Self, Self)](duration/-=(_:_:)-8vzo7.md)
  Subtracts the second value from the first and stores the difference in the left-hand-side variable.
### Type Properties
- [static var zero: Duration](duration/zero.md)
  The zero value.
