### Operators
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeThrough<Self>](duration/'...(_:)-1a3h.md)
  Returns a partial range up to, and including, its upper bound.
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeFrom<Self>](duration/'...(_:)-9h7ny.md)
  Returns a partial range extending upward from a lower bound.
- [static func ... (Self, Self) -> ClosedRange<Self>](duration/'...(_:_:).md)
  Returns a closed range that contains both of its bounds.
- [static func ..< (Self) -> PartialRangeUpTo<Self>](duration/'.._(_:).md)
  Returns a partial range up to, but not including, its upper bound.
- [static func ..< (Self, Self) -> Range<Self>](duration/'.._(_:_:).md)
  Returns a half-open range that contains its lower bound but not its upper bound.
- [static func > (Self, Self) -> Bool](duration/_(_:_:)-1710k.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func < (Duration, Duration) -> Bool](duration/_(_:_:)-ijui.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than that of the second argument.
- [static func <= (Self, Self) -> Bool](duration/_=(_:_:)-2hktt.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (Self, Self) -> Bool](duration/_=(_:_:)-6wrs8.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
