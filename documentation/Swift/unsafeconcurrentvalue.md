## Declaration

```swift

```

## See Also

- [protocol Sendable](sendable.md)
  A thread-safe type whose values can be shared across arbitrary concurrent contexts without introducing a risk of data races.
- [protocol Actor](actor.md)
  Common protocol to which all actors conform.
- [typealias AnyActor](anyactor.md)
  Common marker protocol providing a shared “base” for both (local) `Actor` and (potentially remote) `DistributedActor` types.
- [actor MainActor](mainactor.md)
  A singleton actor whose executor is equivalent to the main dispatch queue.
- [protocol GlobalActor](globalactor.md)
  A type that represents a globally-unique actor that can be used to isolate various declarations anywhere in the program.
- [protocol SendableMetatype](sendablemetatype.md)
  A type whose metatype can be shared across arbitrary concurrent contexts without introducing a risk of data races. When a generic type `T` conforms to `SendableMetatype`, its metatype `T.Type` conforms to `Sendable`.  All concrete types implicitly conform to the `SendableMetatype` protocol, so its primary purpose is in generic code to prohibit the use of isolated conformances along with the generic type.
- [typealias ConcurrentValue](concurrentvalue.md)
- [protocol UnsafeSendable](unsafesendable.md)
  A type whose values can safely be passed across concurrency domains by copying, but which disables some safety checking at the conformance site.
- [macro isolation<T>() -> T](isolation().md)
  Produce a reference to the actor to which the enclosing code is isolated, or `nil` if the code is nonisolated.
