#### Discussion

The [`IEEE 754 specification`](https://developer.apple.comhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4610933) defines a , or preferred, encoding of a floating-point value. On platforms that fully support IEEE 754, every `Float` or `Double` value is canonical, but non-canonical values can exist on other platforms or for other types. Some examples:

- On platforms that flush subnormal numbers to zero (such as armv7 with the default floating-point environment), Swift interprets subnormal `Float` and `Double` values as non-canonical zeros. (In Swift 5.1 and earlier, `isCanonical` is `true` for these values, which is the incorrect value.)
- On i386 and x86_64, `Float80` has a number of non-canonical encodings. “Pseudo-NaNs”, “pseudo-infinities”, and “unnormals” are interpreted as non-canonical NaN encodings. “Pseudo-denormals” are interpreted as non-canonical encodings of subnormal values.
- Decimal floating-point types admit a large number of non-canonical encodings. Consult the IEEE 754 standard for additional details.
