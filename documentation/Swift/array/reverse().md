# reverse()

**Framework**: Swift  
**Kind**: method  
**Role**: Instance Method

Reverses the elements of the collection in place.

**Availability**:
- iOS 8.0+
- iPadOS 8.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.0+
- macOS 10.10+
- tvOS 9.0+

## Declaration

```swift
mutating func reverse()
```

Available when `Self` conforms to `BidirectionalCollection`.

#### Discussion

The following example reverses the elements of an array of characters:

```swift
var characters: [Character] = ["C", "a", "f", "é"]
characters.reverse()
print(characters)
// Prints "["é", "f", "a", "C"]"
```

> **Complexity**: O(*n*), where *n* is the number of elements in the collection.
