### Operators
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeThrough<Self>](uint32/'...(_:)-5u2el.md)
  Returns a partial range up to, and including, its upper bound.
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeFrom<Self>](uint32/'...(_:)-6hglj.md)
  Returns a partial range extending upward from a lower bound.
- [static func ... (Self, Self) -> ClosedRange<Self>](uint32/'...(_:_:).md)
  Returns a closed range that contains both of its bounds.
- [static func ..< (Self) -> PartialRangeUpTo<Self>](uint32/'.._(_:).md)
  Returns a partial range up to, but not including, its upper bound.
- [static func ..< (Self, Self) -> Range<Self>](uint32/'.._(_:_:).md)
  Returns a half-open range that contains its lower bound but not its upper bound.
- [static func < (Self, Self) -> Bool](uint32/_(_:_:)-5v5ah.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than that of the second argument.
- [static func > (Self, Self) -> Bool](uint32/_(_:_:)-67i4z.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func > (UInt32, UInt32) -> Bool](uint32/_(_:_:)-9eky4.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (Self, Self) -> Bool](uint32/_=(_:_:)-3rq79.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func <= (UInt32, UInt32) -> Bool](uint32/_=(_:_:)-573ra.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func <= (Self, Self) -> Bool](uint32/_=(_:_:)-9dxms.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (UInt32, UInt32) -> Bool](uint32/_=(_:_:)-apxe.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
