### Operators
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeFrom<Self>](jobpriority/'...(_:)-94kop.md)
  Returns a partial range extending upward from a lower bound.
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeThrough<Self>](jobpriority/'...(_:)-9gkod.md)
  Returns a partial range up to, and including, its upper bound.
- [static func ... (Self, Self) -> ClosedRange<Self>](jobpriority/'...(_:_:).md)
  Returns a closed range that contains both of its bounds.
- [static func ..< (Self) -> PartialRangeUpTo<Self>](jobpriority/'.._(_:).md)
  Returns a partial range up to, but not including, its upper bound.
- [static func ..< (Self, Self) -> Range<Self>](jobpriority/'.._(_:_:).md)
  Returns a half-open range that contains its lower bound but not its upper bound.
- [static func < (JobPriority, JobPriority) -> Bool](jobpriority/_(_:_:)-53h6k.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than that of the second argument.
- [static func > (Self, Self) -> Bool](jobpriority/_(_:_:)-5pqow.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func > (JobPriority, JobPriority) -> Bool](jobpriority/_(_:_:)-9ghlg.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (JobPriority, JobPriority) -> Bool](jobpriority/_=(_:_:)-3sizb.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func <= (JobPriority, JobPriority) -> Bool](jobpriority/_=(_:_:)-5nd54.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func <= (Self, Self) -> Bool](jobpriority/_=(_:_:)-6zxj9.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (Self, Self) -> Bool](jobpriority/_=(_:_:)-7csjf.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
