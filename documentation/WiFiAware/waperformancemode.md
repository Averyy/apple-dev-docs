# WAPerformanceMode

**Framework**: Wi-Fi Aware  
**Kind**: enum

The performance mode that indicates what performance criterion to prioritize.

**Availability**:
- iOS 26.0+
- iPadOS 26.0+

## Declaration

```swift
enum WAPerformanceMode
```

#### Overview

> ❗ **Important**: Each service must have the same [`WAPerformanceMode`](waperformancemode.md) on both the `NetworkBrowser` (subscriber) and `NetworkListener` (publisher) sides of the connection, or the performance behavior is undefined. If not specified, the performance mode defaults to [`WAPerformanceMode.bulk`](waperformancemode/bulk.md) on both sides.

## Topics

### Setting performance modes
- [WAPerformanceMode.bulk](waperformancemode/bulk.md)
  A mode that prioritizes throughput, power, and support for other concurrent Wi-Fi use cases and devices.
- [WAPerformanceMode.realtime](waperformancemode/realtime.md)
  A mode that prioritizes latency at the expense of throughput, power, and other concurrent Wi-Fi use cases and devices.
