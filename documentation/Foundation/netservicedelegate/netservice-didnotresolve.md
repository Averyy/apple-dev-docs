## Declaration

```swift
optional func netService(_ sender: NetService, didNotResolve errorDict: [String : NSNumber])
```

#### Discussion

Clients may try to resolve again upon receiving this error. For example, a DNS rotary may yield different IP addresses on different resolution requests. A common error condition is that no addresses were resolved during the timeout period specified in [`resolve(withTimeout:)`](netservice/resolve(withtimeout:).md).

## Parameters

- `sender`: The service that did not resolve.
- `errorDict`: A dictionary containing information about the problem. The dictionary contains the keys   and  .
