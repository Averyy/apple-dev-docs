## Declaration

```swift
optional func netServiceWillResolve(_ sender: NetService)
```

#### Discussion

Resolution of the service proceeds asynchronously and may still generate a call to the delegate’s [`netService(_:didNotResolve:)`](netservicedelegate/netservice(_:didnotresolve:).md) method if an error occurs.

## Parameters

- `sender`: The service that the network is ready to resolve.
