#### Discussion

This property identifies the kind of progress for the progress object, such as [`file`](progresskind/file.md). It can be `nil`.

If you set a non-`nil` value to [`kind`](progress/kind.md), the default [`localizedDescription`](progress/localizeddescription.md) getter uses the kind of progress. The [`localizedDescription`](progress/localizeddescription.md) getter determines how to use the values of other properties, along with values in the user info dictionary, to create a string representation.
