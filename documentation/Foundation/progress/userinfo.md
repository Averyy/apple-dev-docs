#### Discussion

A KVO-compliant dictionary that changes in response to [`setUserInfoObject(_:forKey:)`](progress/setuserinfoobject(_:forkey:).md). The dictionary sends all of its KVO notifications on the thread that updates the property.

Some entries have meanings that the `NSProgress` class recognizes. For more information, see Recognizing Kinds of Progress, Using General Keys, Using File Operation Keys, and  Recognizing Kinds of File Operations.
