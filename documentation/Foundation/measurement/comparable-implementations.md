### Operators
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeThrough<Self>](measurement/'...(_:)-2o5x1.md)
  Returns a partial range up to, and including, its upper bound.
- [static func ... (Self) -> PartialRangeFrom<Self>](measurement/'...(_:)-378b4.md)
  Returns a partial range extending upward from a lower bound.
- [static func ... (Self, Self) -> ClosedRange<Self>](measurement/'...(_:_:).md)
  Returns a closed range that contains both of its bounds.
- [static func ..< (Self) -> PartialRangeUpTo<Self>](measurement/'.._(_:).md)
  Returns a partial range up to, but not including, its upper bound.
- [static func ..< (Self, Self) -> Range<Self>](measurement/'.._(_:_:).md)
  Returns a half-open range that contains its lower bound but not its upper bound.
- [static func > (Self, Self) -> Bool](measurement/_(_:_:)-648pf.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than that of the second argument.
- [static func < <LeftHandSideType, RightHandSideType>(Measurement<LeftHandSideType>, Measurement<RightHandSideType>) -> Bool](measurement/_(_:_:)-7pou4.md)
  Compare two measurements of the same `Unit`.
- [static func <= (Self, Self) -> Bool](measurement/_=(_:_:)-12fhs.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is less than or equal to that of the second argument.
- [static func >= (Self, Self) -> Bool](measurement/_=(_:_:)-lnsg.md)
  Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the value of the first argument is greater than or equal to that of the second argument.
