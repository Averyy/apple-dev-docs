# truncateFile(atOffset:)

**Framework**: Foundation  
**Kind**: method

Truncates or extends the file represented by the file handle to a specified offset within the file and puts the file pointer at that position.

**Availability**:
- iOS 2.0+
- iPadOS 2.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- macOS 10.0+
- tvOS 9.0+
- visionOS 1.0+
- watchOS 2.0+

## Declaration

```swift
func truncateFile(atOffset offset: UInt64)
```

#### Discussion

If the file is extended (if `offset` is beyond the current end of file), the added characters are null bytes.

> ❗ **Important**:  This method raises [`fileHandleOperationException`](nsexceptionname/filehandleoperationexception.md) if called on a file handle representing a pipe or socket, if the file descriptor is closed, or if the operation failed.

## Parameters

- `offset`: The offset within the file that marks the new end of the file.
