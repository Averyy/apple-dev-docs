> **Deprecated**: To handle errors when getting the file pointer’s position, use [`offset()`](./offset%28%29.md) in Swift and [`getOffset:error:`](../nsfilehandle/getoffset_error_.md) in Objective-C.

## Declaration

```swift
var offsetInFile: UInt64 { get }
```

```objc
@property (readonly) unsigned long long offsetInFile;
```

#### Discussion

Raises [`fileHandleOperationException`](../nsexceptionname/filehandleoperationexception.md) if called on a file handle representing a pipe or socket, or if the file descriptor is closed.
