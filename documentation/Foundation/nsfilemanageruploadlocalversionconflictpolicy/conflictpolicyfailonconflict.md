```c
NSFileManagerUploadConflictPolicyFailOnConflict
```

#### Discussion

This policy causes an upload to fail if the local version of a file, with any local changes applied, doesn’t match the server version. In this scenario, call [`fetchLatestRemoteVersionOfItem(at:completionHandler:)`](../filemanager/fetchlatestremoteversionofitem%28at,completionhandler%29.md), rebase local changes on top of the newly fetched version, and retry the upload.

This policy is only available on paused items for which the file provider supports the fail-on-conflict behavior. To check that the file provider supports the behavior, get the [`ubiquitousItemSupportedSyncControlsKey`](../urlresourcekey/ubiquitousitemsupportedsynccontrolskey.md) URL resource and verify that [`failUploadOnConflict`](../nsfilemanagersupportedsynccontrols/failuploadonconflict.md) is `true`.
