# appleEvent(forSuspensionID:)

**Framework**: Foundation  
**Kind**: method  
**Role**: Instance Method

Given a nonzero `suspensionID` returned by an invocation of [`suspendCurrentAppleEvent()`](./suspendcurrentappleevent%28%29.md), returns the descriptor for the event whose handling was suspended.

**Availability**:
- Mac Catalyst 13.0+
- macOS 10.0+

## Declaration

```swift
func appleEvent(forSuspensionID suspensionID: NSAppleEventManager.SuspensionID) -> NSAppleEventDescriptor
```

```objc
- (NSAppleEventDescriptor *) appleEventForSuspensionID:(NSAppleEventManagerSuspensionID) suspensionID;
```

#### Discussion

The effects of mutating or retaining the returned descriptor are undefined, although it may be copied. [`appleEvent(forSuspensionID:)`](./appleevent%28forsuspensionid%29.md) may be invoked in any thread, not just the one in which the corresponding invocation of [`suspendCurrentAppleEvent()`](./suspendcurrentappleevent%28%29.md) occurred.
