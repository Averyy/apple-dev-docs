#### Discussion

When a student taps on an assignment associated with an app that adopts ClassKit, the framework redirects the student to the corresponding app using either a universal link or a user activity, depending on the app’s configuration. Use the [`isClassKitDeepLink`](nsuseractivity/isclasskitdeeplink.md) property of a [`NSUserActivity`](nsuseractivity.md) instance that you receive to test if that activity is from ClassKit. See [`Linking directly to assignments`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ClassKit/linking-directly-to-assignments) for more information.
