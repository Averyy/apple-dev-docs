**Framework**: Foundation  
**Kind**: method

Returns the date components representing a given date.

## Declaration

```swift
func components(_ unitFlags: NSCalendar.Unit, from date: Date) -> DateComponents
```

#### Return Value

An `NSDateComponents` object containing `date` decomposed into the components specified by `unitFlags`. Returns `nil` if `date` falls outside of the defined range of the receiver or if the computation cannot be performed.

#### Discussion

The Weekday ordinality, when requested, refers to the next larger (than Week) of the requested units. Some computations can take a relatively long time.

The following example shows how to use this method to determine the current year, month, and day, using an existing calendar (`gregorian`):

```objc
unsigned unitFlags = NSYearCalendarUnit | NSMonthCalendarUnit |  NSDayCalendarUnit;
NSDate *date = [NSDate date];
NSDateComponents *comps = [gregorian components:unitFlags fromDate:date];
```

## Parameters

- `unitFlags`: The components into which to decompose  .
- `date`: The date for which to perform the calculation.
