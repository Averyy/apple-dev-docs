# completePath(into:caseSensitive:matchesInto:filterTypes:)

**Framework**: Foundation  
**Kind**: method

Interprets the receiver as a path in the file system and attempts to perform filename completion, returning a numeric value that indicates whether a match was possible, and by reference the longest path that matches the receiver.

## Declaration

```swift
func completePath(into outputName: AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer<NSString?>?, caseSensitive flag: Bool, matchesInto outputArray: AutoreleasingUnsafeMutablePointer<NSArray?>?, filterTypes: [String]?) -> Int
```

#### Return Value

`0` if no matches are found and `1` if exactly one match is found. In the case of multiple matches, returns the actual number of matching paths if `outputArray` is provided, or simply a positive value if `outputArray` is `NULL`.

#### Discussion

You can check for the existence of matches without retrieving by passing `NULL` as `outputArray`.

Note that this method only works with file paths (not, for example, string representations of URLs).

## Parameters

- `outputName`: Upon return, contains the longest path that matches the receiver.
- `flag`: If  , the method considers case for possible completions.
- `outputArray`: Upon return, contains all matching filenames.
- `filterTypes`: An array of   objects specifying path extensions to consider for completion. Only paths whose extensions (not including the extension separator) match one of these strings are included in  . Pass   if you don’t want to filter the output.
