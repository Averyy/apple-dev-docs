# write(to:atomically:)

**Framework**: Foundation  
**Kind**: method

Writes the contents of the receiver to the location specified by a given URL.

**Availability**:
- tvOS 9.0+
- visionOS 1.0+
- watchOS 2.0+

## Declaration

```swift
func write(to url: URL, atomically: Bool) -> Bool
```

#### Return Value

[`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) if the location is written successfully, otherwise [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false).

#### Discussion

If `atomically` is [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true), the receiver is written to an auxiliary location, and then the auxiliary location is renamed to `aURL`. If `atomically` is [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false), the receiver is written directly to `aURL`. The [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) option guarantees that `aURL`, if it exists at all, won’t be corrupted even if the system should crash during writing.

The `atomically` parameter is ignored if `aURL` is not of a type that can be accessed atomically.
