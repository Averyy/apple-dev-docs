## Declaration

```swift
func folding(options: NSString.CompareOptions = [], locale: Locale?) -> String
```

#### Return Value

A string created by performing a character folding operation with the specified options and locale.

#### Discussion

When working with text—especially text in Latin script—it’s often useful to compare strings in such a way that ignores differences in case (uppercase or lowercase), width (full-width or half-width), and/or diacritics (accents and other marks).

To accomplish this, you may use one of the methods described in Identifying and Comparing Strings, passing one or more options specified by the [`NSString.CompareOptions`](nsstring/compareoptions.md) type as appropriate. If you’re performing many such comparisons, you may instead, as an optimization, perform a single folding operation on the string and store the result, passing that into a more efficient comparison method. For example, if you were determining the case-insensitive (that is, “HELLO”, “hello”, and “Hello” are all considered equal) intersection of two sets of strings, instead of calling the [`localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare(_:)`](nsstring/localizedcaseinsensitivecompare(_:).md) method for each pair of strings, you might first normalize both sets of strings by calling the [`folding(options:locale:)`](nsstring/folding(options:locale:).md) method, passing the [`caseInsensitive`](nsstring/compareoptions/caseinsensitive.md) option and the current locale, and then compare each pair of folded strings using the [`isEqual(to:)`](nsstring/isequal(to:).md) method.

> 💡 **Tip**:  Character folding operations using the [`folding(options:locale:)`](nsstring/folding(options:locale:).md) method are often more performant than the equivalent string transform using the [`applyingTransform(_:reverse:)`](nsstring/applyingtransform(_:reverse:).md) method.

Rules for how characters are folded may vary, depending on the locale. For example, when folding a string containing the character “I” (`U+0049` `LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I`) and specifying the [`caseInsensitive`](nsstring/compareoptions/caseinsensitive.md) comparison option, an English-speaking locale returns “i” (`U+0069` `LATIN SMALL LETTER I`), and a Turkish-speaking locale returns “ı” (`U+0131 LATIN SMALL DOTLESS I`).

> **Note**:  The result of character folding operations may not be suitable for display to users, and should be used only for internal processing.

## Parameters

- `options`: Any combination of the   ,  , and   comparison options.
- `locale`: The locale to use for the folding operation. Pass   to use the system locale.
