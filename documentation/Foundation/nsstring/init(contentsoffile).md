# init(contentsOfFile:)

**Framework**: Foundation  
**Kind**: init  
**Role**: Initializer

Initializes the receiver, a newly allocated `NSString` object, by reading data from the file named by `path`.

**Availability**:

> **Deprecated**: Use [`init(contentsOfFile:encoding:)`](./init%28contentsoffile,encoding%29.md) or [`init(contentsOfFile:usedEncoding:)`](./init%28contentsoffile,usedencoding%29.md) instead.

## Declaration

```swift
convenience init?(contentsOfFile path: String)
```

```objc
- (id) initWithContentsOfFile:(NSString *) path;
```

#### Discussion

Initializes the receiver, a newly allocated `NSString` object, by reading data from the file named by `path`. If the contents begin with a byte-order mark (`U+FEFF` or `U+FFFE`), interprets the contents as UTF-16 code units; otherwise interprets the contents as data in the default C string encoding. Returns an initialized object, which might be different from the original receiver, or `nil` if the file can’t be opened.
