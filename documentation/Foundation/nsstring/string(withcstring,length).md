# string(withCString:length:)

**Framework**: Foundation  
**Kind**: method  
**Role**: Type Method

Returns a string containing the characters in a given C-string.

## Declaration

```swift
class func string(withCString bytes: UnsafePointer<CChar>, length: Int) -> Any?
```

```objc
+ (id) stringWithCString:(const char *) bytes length:(NSUInteger) length;
```

#### Discussion

`cString` must not be NULL. `cString` should contain characters in the default C-string encoding. This method converts `length` * `sizeof(char)` bytes from `cString` and doesn’t stop short at a `NULL` character.
