# init(contentsOfURL:)

**Framework**: Foundation  
**Kind**: init

Initializes the receiver, a newly allocated `NSString` object, by reading data from the location named by a given URL.

**Availability**:
- tvOS 9.0+
- visionOS 1.0+
- watchOS 2.0+

## Declaration

```swift
convenience init?(contentsOf url: URL)
```

#### Discussion

Initializes the receiver, a newly allocated `NSString` object, by reading data from the location named by `aURL`. If the contents begin with a byte-order mark (`U+FEFF` or `U+FFFE`), interprets the contents as UTF-16 code units; otherwise interprets the contents as data in the default C string encoding. Returns an initialized object, which might be different from the original receiver, or `nil` if the location can’t be opened.
