## Declaration

```swift
func path(forResource name: String?, ofType ext: String?, inDirectory subpath: String?) -> String?
```

#### Return Value

The full pathname for the resource file, or `nil` if the file could not be located.

#### Discussion

If `subpath` is `nil`, this method searches the top-level nonlocalized resource directory and the top-level of any language-specific directories. (In macOS, the top-level nonlocalized resource directory is typically called `Resources` but in iOS, it is the main bundle directory.) For example, suppose you have a Mac app with a modern bundle and you specify `@"Documentation"` for the `subpath` parameter. This method would first look in the `Contents/Resources/Documentation` directory of the bundle, followed by the `Documentation` subdirectories of each language-specific `.lproj` directory.

Whether this method recurses through subdirectories is dependent on the `extension` parameter. If `nil` or an empty string it will recurse, otherwise, it does not. (The search order for the language-specific directories corresponds to the user’s preferences.) For details on how localized resources are found, read [`The Bundle Search Pattern`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/AccessingaBundlesContents/AccessingaBundlesContents.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000123i-CH104-SW7) in [`Bundle Programming Guide`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000123i).

## Parameters

- `name`: If you specify  , the method returns the first resource file it finds that matches the remaining criteria.
- `ext`: If you specify an empty string or  , all the files in   and its subdirectories are returned. If an extension is provided the subdirectories are not searched.
- `subpath`: The name of the bundle subdirectory.
