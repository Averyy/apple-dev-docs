## Declaration

```swift
func path(forResource name: String?, ofType ext: String?) -> String?
```

#### Return Value

The full pathname for the resource file, or `nil` if the file could not be located.

#### Discussion

The method first looks for a matching resource file in the non-localized resource directory of the specified bundle. If a matching resource file is not found, it then looks in the top level of an available language-specific `.lproj` folder. (The search order for the language-specific folders corresponds to the user’s preferences.) It does not recurse through other subfolders at any of these locations. For more details on how localized resources are found, read [`The Bundle Search Pattern`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/AccessingaBundlesContents/AccessingaBundlesContents.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000123i-CH104-SW7) in [`Bundle Programming Guide`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000123i).

The following code fragment gets the path to a plist within the bundle, and loads it into an `NSDictionary`:

```objc
NSBundle *thisBundle = [NSBundle bundleForClass:[self class]];
if (commonDictionaryPath = [thisBundle pathForResource:@"CommonDictionary" ofType:@"plist"]) {
    theDictionary = [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:commonDictionaryPath];
}
```

## Parameters

- `name`: If you specify  , the method returns the first resource file it finds with the specified extension.
- `ext`: If you specify an empty string or  , the extension is assumed not to exist and the file is the first file encountered that exactly matches  .
