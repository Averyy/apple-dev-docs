## Declaration

```swift
func url(forResource name: String?, withExtension ext: String?, subdirectory subpath: String?) -> URL?
```

```objc
- (NSURL *) URLForResource:(NSString *) name withExtension:(NSString *) ext subdirectory:(NSString *) subpath;
```

#### Return Value

The file URL for the resource file or `nil` if the file could not be located. This method also returns `nil` if the bundle specified by the `bundlePath` parameter does not exist or is not a readable directory.

#### Discussion

For details on how localized resources are found, read [The Bundle Search Pattern](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/AccessingaBundlesContents/AccessingaBundlesContents.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000123i-CH104-SW7) in [Bundle Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000123i).

## Parameters

- `name`: The name of a resource file contained in the directory specified by `subpath`.

  If you specify `nil`, the method returns the first resource file it finds with the specified extension in that directory.
- `ext`: The filename extension of the file to locate.

  If you specify an empty string or `nil`, the extension is assumed not to exist and the file URL is the first file encountered that exactly matches `name`.
- `subpath`: The path of a top-level bundle directory. This must be a valid path. For example, to specify the bundle directory for a Mac app, you might specify the path `/Applications/MyApp.app`.
