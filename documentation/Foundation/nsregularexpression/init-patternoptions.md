#### Discussion

> **Note**:  In Swift, this API is imported as an initializer and is marked with the `throws` keyword to indicate that it throws an error in cases of failure. You call this method in a `try` expression and handle any errors in the `catch` clauses of a `do` statement, as described in [`Error Handling`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ErrorHandling.html) in [`The Swift Programming Language`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) and `About Imported Cocoa Error Parameters`.
