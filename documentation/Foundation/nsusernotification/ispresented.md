#### Discussion

In some cases, for example when your application is frontmost, the notification center may decide not to actually present a delivered notification. In that case, the value of this property is [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/false). It is set to [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/true) if the notification was presented according to user preferences.
