# domain

**Framework**: Foundation  
**Kind**: property

A string containing the domain for this service.

**Availability**:
- iOS 2.0+
- iPadOS 2.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- macOS 10.2+
- tvOS 9.0+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
var domain: String { get }
```

#### Discussion

This can be an explicit domain name or it can contain the generic local domain name, `@"local."` (note the trailing period, which indicates an absolute name).

This property’s value is set when the object is first initialized, whether by your code or by a browser object. See [`init(domain:type:name:)`](netservice/init(domain:type:name:).md) for more information.

> **Note**:  This became a property in OS X v10.9 and iOS 7, but the underlying getter method (`domain`) has been available since this class was first introduced.
