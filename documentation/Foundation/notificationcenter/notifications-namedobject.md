## Declaration

```swift
@preconcurrency
func notifications(named name: Notification.Name, object: (any AnyObject & Sendable)? = nil) -> NotificationCenter.Notifications
```

#### Return Value

An asynchronous sequence of notifications from the center.

#### Discussion

Use this method to receive notifications from the center as an [`AsyncSequence`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/AsyncSequence). You iterate over this sequence with `for`-`await`-`in` syntax.

[`Notification`](notification.md) doesn’t conform to [`Sendable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Sendable), because several of its members can’t be sendable, such as [`object`](notification/object.md) and the [`userInfo`](notification/userinfo.md) dictionary. If you iterate over the notifications in this sequence, Xcode issues a warning about crossing an actor boundary. To handle this, use a `NotificationCenter/Notifications/map(_:)-3wc5j` or `NotificationCenter/Notifications/compactMap(_:)-6wlbd` to extract sendable properties of the notification, such as its [`name`](notification/name-swift.property.md) or sendable values from the [`userInfo`](notification/userinfo.md) dictionary.

The following macOS example calls [`notifications(named:object:)`](notificationcenter/notifications(named:object:).md) to receive an asynchronous sequence of [`didActivateApplicationNotification`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSWorkspace/didActivateApplicationNotification) notifications from the shared [`NSWorkspace`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSWorkspace) notification center. It then uses a `NotificationCenter/Notifications/compactMap(_:)-6wlbd` to retrieve [`NSRunningApplication`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSRunningApplication) values from the notification’s [`userInfo`](notification/userinfo.md) dictionary, from which it gets [`localizedName`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppKit/NSRunningApplication/localizedName) strings. Since the [`String`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/String) type conforms to [`Sendable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Sendable), you can iterate over this type without a compiler warning.

```swift
for await appName in NSWorkspace.shared.notificationCenter.notifications (
    named: NSWorkspace.didActivateApplicationNotification)
    .compactMap ({ notification in
        guard let appInfo = notification.userInfo?[NSWorkspace.applicationUserInfoKey] as? NSRunningApplication,
              let name = appInfo.localizedName else { return nil as String? }
        return name
    })
{
    print("Application activated: \(appName)")
}
```

## Parameters

- `name`: A notification name. The sequence includes only notifications with this name.
- `object`: A source object of notifications. Specify a sender object to deliver only notifications from that sender. When  , the notification center doesn’t consider the sender as a criteria for delivery.
