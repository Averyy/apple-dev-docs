## Declaration

```swift
var fileSystemRepresentation: UnsafePointer<CChar> { get }
```

#### Discussion

This returns a null-terminated C string in file system representation.

This string is automatically freed in the same way that a returned object would be released. The caller must either copy the string or use [`getFileSystemRepresentation(_:maxLength:)`](nsurl/getfilesystemrepresentation(_:maxlength:).md) if it needs to store the representation outside of the autorelease context in which the value was obtained.

The file system representation format is described in File Encodings and Fonts.
