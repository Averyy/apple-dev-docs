## Declaration

```swift
var resolvingSymlinksInPath: URL? { get }
```

#### Discussion

If the receiver has no symbolic links, this property contains a copy of the original URL.

If some symbolic links cannot be resolved, this property contains those broken symbolic links.

If the name of the receiving path begins with `/private`, this property strips off the `/private` designator, provided the result is the name of an existing file.

This property only works on URLs with the `file:` path scheme. For all other URLs, it contains a copy of the receiver.
