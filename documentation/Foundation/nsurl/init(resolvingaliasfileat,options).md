# init(resolvingAliasFileAt:options:)

**Framework**: Foundation  
**Kind**: init  
**Role**: Initializer

Returns a new URL made by resolving the alias file at `url`.

**Availability**:

## Declaration

```swift
convenience init(resolvingAliasFileAt url: URL, options: NSURL.BookmarkResolutionOptions = []) throws
```

```objc
+ (instancetype) URLByResolvingAliasFileAtURL:(NSURL *) url options:(NSURLBookmarkResolutionOptions) options error:(NSError **) error;
```

#### Return Value

A new URL created by resolving the bookmark data derived from the provided alias file. If an error occurs, this method returns `nil`.

#### Discussion

Creates and initializes a new URL based on the alias file at `url`. Use this method to resolve bookmark data that was saved using [`writeBookmarkData(_:to:options:)`](./writebookmarkdata%28_,to,options%29.md) and resolves that data in one step.

If the `url` argument does not refer to an alias file as defined by the `NSURLIsAliasFileKey` property, this method returns the `url` argument.

If the `url` argument is unreachable, this method returns `nil` and the optional error argument is populated.

> **Handling Errors in Swift**:  In Swift, this method returns a nonoptional result and is marked with the `throws` keyword to indicate that it throws an error in cases of failure.
>
> You call this method in a `try` expression and handle any errors in the `catch` clauses of a `do` statement, as described in [Error Handling](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ErrorHandling.html) in [The Swift Programming Language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) and `About Imported Cocoa Error Parameters`.

## Parameters

- `url`: The URL pointing to the alias file.
- `options`: Options taken into account when resolving the bookmark data. The [`withSecurityScope`](./bookmarkresolutionoptions/withsecurityscope.md) option is not supported by this method.
