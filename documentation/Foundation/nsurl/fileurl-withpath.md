#### Return Value

An NSURL object initialized with `path`.

#### Discussion

This method assumes that `path` is a directory if it ends with a slash. If `path` does not end with a slash, the method examines the file system to determine if `path` is a file or a directory. If `path` exists in the file system and is a directory, the method appends a trailing slash. If `path` does not exist in the file system, the method assumes that it represents a file and does not append a trailing slash.

As an alternative, consider using [`fileURL(withPath:isDirectory:)`](nsurl/fileurl(withpath:isdirectory:).md), which allows you to explicitly specify whether the returned `NSURL` object represents a file or directory.

## Parameters

- `path`: The path that the NSURL object will represent.   should be a valid system path, and must not be an empty path. If   begins with a tilde, it must first be expanded with  . If   is a relative path, it is treated as being relative to the current working directory.
