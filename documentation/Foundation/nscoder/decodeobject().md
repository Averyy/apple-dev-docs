## Declaration

```swift
func decodeObject() -> Any?
```

```objc
- (id) decodeObject;
```

#### Discussion

`NSCoder`’s implementation invokes [`decodeValue(ofObjCType:at:)`](./decodevalue%28ofobjctype,at%29.md) to decode the object data.

Subclasses may need to override this method if they override any of the corresponding `encode…Object` methods. For example, if an object was encoded conditionally using the [`encodeConditionalObject(_:)`](./encodeconditionalobject%28_%29.md) method, this method needs to check whether the object had actually been encoded.
