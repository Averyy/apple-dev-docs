## Declaration

```swift
func upload(for request: URLRequest, from bodyData: Data, delegate: (any URLSessionTaskDelegate)? = nil) async throws -> (Data, URLResponse)
```

#### Return Value

An asynchronously-delivered tuple that contains any data returned by the server as a [`Data`](data.md) instance, and a [`URLResponse`](urlresponse.md).

## Parameters

- `request`: A URL request object that provides request-specific information such as the URL, cache policy, request type, and body data or body stream.
- `bodyData`: The body data for the request.
- `delegate`: A delegate that receives life cycle and authentication challenge callbacks as the transfer progresses.
