## Declaration

```swift
protocol NSLocking
```

#### Overview

A lock object is used to coordinate the actions of multiple threads of execution within a single application. By using a lock object, an application can protect critical sections of code from being executed simultaneously by separate threads, thus protecting shared data and other shared resources from corruption.

## Topics

### Working with Locks
- [func lock()](nslocking/lock.md)
  Attempts to acquire a lock, blocking a thread’s execution until the lock can be acquired.
- [func unlock()](nslocking/unlock.md)
  Relinquishes a previously acquired lock.
### Instance Methods
- [func withLock<R>(() throws -> R) rethrows -> R](nslocking/withlock(_:).md)

## Relationships

### Conforming Types
- [NSCondition](nscondition.md)
- [NSConditionLock](nsconditionlock.md)
- [NSLock](nslock.md)
- [NSRecursiveLock](nsrecursivelock.md)

## See Also

- [class Thread](thread.md)
  A thread of execution.
- [class NSLock](nslock.md)
  An object that coordinates the operation of multiple threads of execution within the same application.
- [class NSRecursiveLock](nsrecursivelock.md)
  A lock that may be acquired multiple times by the same thread without causing a deadlock.
- [class NSDistributedLock](nsdistributedlock.md)
  A lock that multiple applications on multiple hosts can use to restrict access to some shared resource, such as a file.
- [class NSConditionLock](nsconditionlock.md)
  A lock that can be associated with specific, user-defined conditions.
- [class NSCondition](nscondition.md)
  A condition variable whose semantics follow those used for POSIX-style conditions.
