- Combine multiple [`EntitlementsQuery`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/LightweightCodeRequirements/EntitlementsQuery) constraints using the `anyOf` and `allOf` operators.
- Use the [`Equatable`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/Equatable) protocol to compare instances of [`LaunchCodeRequirement`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/LightweightCodeRequirements/LaunchCodeRequirement), [`ProcessCodeRequirement`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/LightweightCodeRequirements/ProcessCodeRequirement), and [`OnDiskCodeRequirement`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/LightweightCodeRequirements/OnDiskCodeRequirement).
- Use [`SecCodeCheckValidityWithOnDiskRequirement(code:flags:requirement:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/LightweightCodeRequirements/SecCodeCheckValidityWithOnDiskRequirement(code:flags:requirement:)) to test a [`SecCode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/SecCode) instance using an on-disk code requirement.
- Use [`SecCodeCheckValidityWithProcessRequirement(code:flags:requirement:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/LightweightCodeRequirements/SecCodeCheckValidityWithProcessRequirement(code:flags:requirement:)) to test a [`SecCode`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Security/SecCode) instance using a process code requirement.
