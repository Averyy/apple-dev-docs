#### June 2024

- Make symbols even more expressive with new animations. Find new ways to respond to people’s input, convey status changes, and signal ongoing activity with [`WiggleSymbolEffect`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Symbols/WiggleSymbolEffect), [`RotateSymbolEffect`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Symbols/RotateSymbolEffect), and [`BreatheSymbolEffect`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Symbols/BreatheSymbolEffect).
- Allow symbols to more intelligently transition between related variants with [`magic(fallback:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Symbols/ReplaceSymbolEffect/magic(fallback:)). Slashes can now draw on and off, and badges can appear and disappear, or be replaced independently of the base symbol.
- Use [`repeat(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Symbols/SymbolEffectOptions/repeat(_:)-316cr) for new playback options for repeating animations. Apply a delay between repetitions, and use new, continuous repeat behavior with [`continuous`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Symbols/SymbolEffectOptions/RepeatBehavior/continuous) to produce smoother animations when repeating indefinitely.
