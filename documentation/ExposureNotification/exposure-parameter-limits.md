  The minimum and maximum signal attenuations.
- [Risk Level](risk-level.md)
  The minimum and maximum risk levels.
- [Risk Level Value](risk-level-value.md)
  The minimum and maximum risk level values.
- [Risk Score](risk-score.md)
  The minimum and maximum risk score.
- [Risk Weight](risk-weight.md)
  The minimum, default, and maximum risk weights.
- [struct ENActivityFlags](enactivityflags.md)
  Activities that occur while the app isn’t running.
- [enum ENCalibrationConfidence](encalibrationconfidence.md)
