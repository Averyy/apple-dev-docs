```swift

```

#### Discussion

When share access requests are allowed, uninvited users can request to join the share. All pending access requests appear in this array. Each requester is returned with name components and either an email or phone number.

Either share owners or administrators can respond to these access requests.

##### Responding to Access Requests

- - Fetch the participant information by running [`CKFetchShareParticipantsOperation`](ckfetchshareparticipantsoperation.md) with the requester’s [`participantLookupInfo`](ckshare/accessrequester/participantlookupinfo.md).
- Add the resulting participant to the share.
- - Use [`denyRequesters(_:)`](ckshare/denyrequesters(_:).md) to remove the requester from the requesters list.
- - Use [`blockRequesters(_:)`](ckshare/blockrequesters(_:).md) to block requesters.
- Blocking a requester prevents them from sending future access requests to the share.
