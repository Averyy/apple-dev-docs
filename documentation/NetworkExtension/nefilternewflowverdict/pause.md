# pause()

**Framework**: Network Extension  
**Kind**: method

Creates a verdict that tells the system to pause the flow.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.15+

## Declaration

```swift
class func pause() -> NEFilterNewFlowVerdict
```

#### Discussion

Once paused, the system doesn’t call any of the data provider’s handler callbacks until you resume the flow by calling [`resumeFlow(_:with:)`](nefilterdataprovider/resumeflow(_:with:).md).

You can pause TCP flows indefinitely. You can pause UDP flows for up to 10 seconds, after which the system drops the flow. Pausing a flow that’s already paused is an invalid operation.
