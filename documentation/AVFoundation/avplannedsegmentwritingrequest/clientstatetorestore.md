# clientStateToRestore

**Framework**: AVFoundation  
**Kind**: property

The client state persisted from the previous segment, if any. Specifically, this is the NSData provided to the previous segment’s finishWithClientState: method. The client is responsible to restore its client state before writing the current segment. For example, clients such as compositors with a temporal element may need some processing history of previous samples in order to generate an output sample at time N. This will be nil for algorithms that are stateless.

**Availability**:
- iOS 27.0+ (Beta)
- iPadOS 27.0+ (Beta)
- Mac Catalyst 27.0+ (Beta)
- macOS 27.0+ (Beta)
- tvOS 27.0+ (Beta)
