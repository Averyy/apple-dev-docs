#### Discussion

If the value of the property is nil, any UI elements triggered by the AVPlayerInterstitialEventController, such as the skip button, may contain a generic label based on the implementation of the UI that’s in use. To ensure the best available user experience in various playback configurations, including external playback, set a value for this property that provides localized translations of skip control labels.
