**Framework**: AVFoundation  
**Kind**: method

Informs the delegate that a prior loading request has been cancelled.

**Availability**:

- iPadOS 7.0+

- macOS 10.9+
- tvOS 9.0+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
optional func resourceLoader(_ resourceLoader: AVAssetResourceLoader, didCancel loadingRequest: AVAssetResourceLoadingRequest)
```

#### Discussion

Previously issued loading requests can be cancelled when data from the resource is no longer required or when a loading request is superseded by new requests for data from the same resource.

For example, if to complete a seek operation it becomes necessary to load a range of bytes that’s different from a range previously requested, the prior request may be cancelled while the delegate is still handling it.

## Parameters

- `resourceLoader`: The resource loader.
- `loadingRequest`: The loading request that has been cancelled.
