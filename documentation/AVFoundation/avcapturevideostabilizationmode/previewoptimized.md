# AVCaptureVideoStabilizationMode.previewOptimized

**Framework**: AVFoundation  
**Kind**: case

A mode that uses the preview optimized stabilization algorithm.

**Availability**:
- iOS 17.0+
- iPadOS 17.0+
- Mac Catalyst 17.0+
- tvOS 17.0+

## Declaration

```swift
case previewOptimized
```

#### Discussion

Preview stabilization is a low-latency and low-power algorithm which the system supports only on connections that have either an associated preview layer or a preview-sized [`AVCaptureVideoDataOutput`](avcapturevideodataoutput.md).

  A mode that stabilizes video using the enhanced extended cinematic stabilization algorithm.
- [AVCaptureVideoStabilizationMode.auto](avcapturevideostabilizationmode/auto.md)
  A mode that indicates the system chooses the most appropriate video stabilization mode for the device and format.
- [AVCaptureVideoStabilizationMode.lowLatency](avcapturevideostabilizationmode/lowlatency.md)
  Indicates that video should be stabilized using the low latency stabilization algorithm. Low Latency stabilization has a reduced field of view. Enabling low latency stabilization introduces no additional latency into the video capture pipeline.
