#### Discussion

Content providers use the SPC to distinguish the playback device from other devices, typically to enforce per-screen business rule limits. If the app developer, in cooperation with the content vendor, does not require to distinguish the playback device, they can further enhance user privacy by making this identifier non-constant, using this option. In either case, apps are not allowed to store or use the FairPlay anonymized device ID for anything other than to enforce business rule limits. App developers must use the AppTrackingTransparency framework to disclose to users if the application or the related FairPlay Key Server collect data about end users and share it with other companies for purposes of tracking across apps and web sites. When true, the system generates a random seed with which the device id will be randomized. To override the seed used; use this property in conjunction with AVContentKeyRequestRandomDeviceIdentifierSeedKey to provide a seed generated by your application.
