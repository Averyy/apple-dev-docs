# preferredMediaChunkDuration

**Framework**: AVFoundation  
**Kind**: property

The maximum duration to use for each chunk of sample data written to the file for file types that support media chunk duration.

**Availability**:

- iPadOS 13.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- macOS 10.11+

## Declaration

```swift
var preferredMediaChunkDuration: CMTime { get set }
```

#### Discussion

The total duration of the samples in a chunk can be no greater than the preferred chunk duration, or the duration of a single sample if the single sample’s duration is greater than the preferred chunk duration. The default media chunk duration is `1.0` second. Setting a negative or non-numeric value for the chunk duration will cause an error.
