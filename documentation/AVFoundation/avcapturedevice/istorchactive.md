# isTorchActive

**Framework**: AVFoundation  
**Kind**: property

A Boolean value that indicates whether the device’s torch is currently active.

**Availability**:
- iOS 6.0+
- iPadOS 6.0+
- Mac Catalyst 14.0+
- macOS 10.15+

## Declaration

```swift
var isTorchActive: Bool { get }
```

#### Discussion

A torch must be present on the device and currently available before it can be active.

This property is key-value observable.
