```objc
@property (nonatomic) AVCaptureFocusMode focusMode;
```

#### Discussion

Before changing the value of this property, you must call [`lockForConfiguration()`](./lockforconfiguration%28%29.md) to acquire exclusive access to the device’s configuration properties. Otherwise, setting the value of this property raises an exception. When you finish configuring the device, call [`unlockForConfiguration()`](./unlockforconfiguration%28%29.md) to release the lock and allow other devices to configure the settings.

This property is key-value observable.
