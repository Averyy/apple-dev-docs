# isSmoothAutoFocusEnabled

**Framework**: AVFoundation  
**Kind**: property

A Boolean value that indicates whether smooth autofocus is in an enabled state on the device.

**Availability**:
- iOS 7.0+
- iPadOS 7.0+
- Mac Catalyst 14.0+
- tvOS 17.0+

## Declaration

```swift
var isSmoothAutoFocusEnabled: Bool { get set }
```

#### Discussion

On capable devices, you can enable a focusing mode in which the camera makes lens movements more slowly. This mode make focus transitions less visually intrusive, a behavior that you may want for video capture.

Before changing the value of this property, you must call [`lockForConfiguration()`](avcapturedevice/lockforconfiguration().md) to acquire exclusive access to the device’s configuration properties. Otherwise, setting the value of this property raises an exception. When you finish configuring the device, call [`unlockForConfiguration()`](avcapturedevice/unlockforconfiguration().md) to release the lock and allow other devices to configure the settings.
