# AVCaptureDeferredPhotoProxy

**Framework**: AVFoundation  
**Kind**: class

A lightly-processed photo with data that the system may use to process and fetch a higher-resolution asset at a later time.

**Availability**:
- iOS 17.0+
- iPadOS 17.0+

## Declaration

```swift
class AVCaptureDeferredPhotoProxy
```

#### Overview

A photo proxy behaves like a normal [`AVCapturePhoto`](avcapturephoto.md), and approximates the look of the final rendered image. This object represents intermediate data that the system can render into a final image and ingested into the user’s photo library using the [`PhotoKit`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/PhotoKit) framework. The intermediate data aren’t accessible by the calling process.
