# rawPhotoDimensions

**Framework**: AVFoundation  
**Kind**: property

The size, in pixels, of the RAW-format photo image that the capture delivers.

**Availability**:

## Declaration

```swift
var rawPhotoDimensions: CMVideoDimensions { get }
```

#### Discussion

The output dimensions of a captured image are set at the moment of capture, depending on device orientation and capture session configuration. (For example, when the capture session includes a video output and video stabilization is in use, captured photos are smaller.)

This property provides the dimensions of the image to be delivered in the  [`photoOutput(_:didFinishProcessingPhoto:error:)`](avcapturephotocapturedelegate/photooutput(_:didfinishprocessingphoto:error:).md) method. Use this property in earlier delegate methods to find the size of the image before delivery.

If you do not request capture in RAW format, this property’s value has zero width and zero height.
