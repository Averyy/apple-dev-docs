# AVAsynchronousCIImageFilteringRequest

**Framework**: AVFoundation  
**Kind**: class

An object that supports using Core Image filters to process an individual video frame in a video composition.

**Availability**:

- macOS 10.11+
- tvOS 9.0+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
class AVAsynchronousCIImageFilteringRequest
```

#### Overview

You use this class when creating a composition for Core Image filtering with the [`init(asset:applyingCIFiltersWithHandler:)`](avvideocomposition/init(asset:applyingcifilterswithhandler:).md) method. In that method call, you provide a block to be called by AVFoundation as it processes each frame of video, and the block’s sole parameter is a [`AVAsynchronousCIImageFilteringRequest`](avasynchronousciimagefilteringrequest.md) object. Use that object both to the video frame image to be filtered and allows you to return a filtered image to AVFoundation for display or export. The code listing below shows an example of applying a filter to an asset.

> 💡 **Tip**:  To use the created video composition for playback, create an [`AVPlayerItem`](avplayeritem.md) object from the same asset used as the composition’s source, then assign the composition to the player item’s [`videoComposition`](avplayeritem/videocomposition.md) property. To export the composition to a new movie file, create an [`AVAssetExportSession`](avassetexportsession.md) object from the same source asset, then assign the composition to the export session’s [`videoComposition`](avassetexportsession/videocomposition.md) property.

## Topics

### Getting the Image to be Filtered
- [var sourceImage: CIImage](avasynchronousciimagefilteringrequest/sourceimage.md)
  The current video frame image.
### Getting Contextual Information for Filtering
- [var compositionTime: CMTime](avasynchronousciimagefilteringrequest/compositiontime.md)
  The time in the video composition corresponding to the frame being processed.
- [var renderSize: CGSize](avasynchronousciimagefilteringrequest/rendersize.md)
  The width and height, in pixels, of the frame being processed.
### Returning the Filtered Image
- [func finish(with: CIImage, context: CIContext?)](avasynchronousciimagefilteringrequest/finish(with:context:).md)
  Provides the filtered video frame image to AVFoundation for further processing or display.
- [func finish(with: any Error)](avasynchronousciimagefilteringrequest/finish(with:).md)
  Notifies AVFoundation that you cannot fulfill the image filtering request.
