# observedMaxBitrate

**Framework**: AVFoundation  
**Kind**: property

The maximum observed segment download bit rate.

**Availability**:
- iOS 7.0+
- iPadOS 7.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+

- watchOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
var observedMaxBitrate: Double { get }
```

#### Discussion

The value of the property is negative if unknown.

Corresponds to “c-observed-max-bitrate”.

This property is not compatible with key-value observing.
