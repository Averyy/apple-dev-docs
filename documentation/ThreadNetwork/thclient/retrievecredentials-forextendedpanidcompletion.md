```

#### Discussion

> **Note**: You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration: ```swift
func credentials(forExtendedPANID extendedPANID: Data) async throws -> THCredentials

When calling this method, an alert appears asking for user permission to access credentials.

Call the method as follows:

```swift
func obtainCredentials(xpanID: Data) async -> (cred: THCredentials? ,err: Error? ) {
    let client = THClient()
    var credential: THCredentials?
    var err:Error?
    do {
        credential = try await client.credentials(forExtendedPANID: xpanID as Data)
    } catch {
        err = error
    }
    return (credential, err)
}
```

## Parameters

- `extendedPANID`: The extended PAN identifier.
- `completion`: The completion handler the framework calls when the credentials become available.
