#### Discussion

This entitlement works with the [`Declared Age Range`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeclaredAgeRange) framework, which enables people to share their age range with your app.

To use Declared Age Range, add this entitlement to your app by enabling the Declared Age Range capability on your target in Xcode. For more information, refer to [`Adding capabilities to your app`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/adding-capabilities-to-your-app).
