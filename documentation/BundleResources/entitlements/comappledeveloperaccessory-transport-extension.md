#### Discussion

Set the value of this entitlement to `true` to enable your app to use the [`AccessoryTransportExtension`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AccessoryTransportExtension) framework. This framework allows you to send sensitive information to accessories you’ve discovered and set up with [`AccessorySetupKit`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/AccessorySetupKit).

For more information about adding entitlements to your app, refer to [`Adding capabilities to your app`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode/adding-capabilities-to-your-app).
