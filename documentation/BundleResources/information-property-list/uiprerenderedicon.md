# UIPrerenderedIcon

**Framework**: Bundle Resources  
**Kind**: typealias

A Boolean value that indicates whether the app’s icon contains a shine effect.

**Availability**:
- iOS 2.0+
- iPadOS 2.0+
- tvOS 9.0+
- watchOS 2.0+

#### Discussion

If `YES`, the system doesn’t apply a shine effect to the app icon; otherwise, it does. If your app icon already has a shine, set this key to `YES` to prevent the system from applying the same effect again. The default value is `NO`.
