#### Discussion

The system uses this string in visionOS 2-2.3 to tell someone why your app requests permission to use the main camera. In newer versions of visionOS, the system uses the value of [`NSMainCameraUsageDescription`](information-property-list/nsmaincamerausagedescription.md) instead.

For information about using the main camera in your visionOS app, see [`Accessing the main camera`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionOS/accessing-the-main-camera).
