# NSAlwaysAllowMicrophoneModeControl

**Framework**: Bundle Resources  
**Kind**: typealias

A Boolean value that indicates if a person can configure a microphone mode regardless of whether the microphone is in an active state.

**Availability**:

- iPadOS 18.0+

#### Discussion

When your app is in the foreground, use this key to allow someone to configure their microphone mode — automatic, standard, voice isolation, or wide spectrum — before activating the microphone. For example, a person can configure the microphone mode to voice isolation before starting a call in your teleconferencing app.
