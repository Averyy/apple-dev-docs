# TotalBackgroundTimeMetric

**Framework**: MetricKit  
**Kind**: struct

A metric that measures the total time the app spent active in the background.

**Availability**:
- iOS 27.0+ (Beta)
- iPadOS 27.0+ (Beta)
- Mac Catalyst 27.0+ (Beta)

## Declaration

```swift
struct TotalBackgroundTimeMetric
```

#### Discussion

This metric corresponds to the [`MetricResult.totalBackgroundTime(_:)`](metricresult/totalbackgroundtime(_:).md) case. It appears in both [`intervalEntries`](metricreport/intervalentries.md) and [`stateEntries`](metricreport/stateentries.md) when state reporting is enabled.

This type replaces the `cumulativeBackgroundTime` property of [`MXAppRunTimeMetric`](mxappruntimemetric.md).
