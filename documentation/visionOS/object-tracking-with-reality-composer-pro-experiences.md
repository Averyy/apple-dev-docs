# Object tracking with Reality Composer Pro experiences

**Framework**: visionOS

Use object tracking in visionOS to attach digital content to real objects to create engaging experiences.

**Availability**:
- visionOS 2.0+
- Xcode 16.2+

#### Overview

> **Note**: This sample code project is associated with WWDC24 session [`100101: Explore object tracking for visionOS`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/10101/).

##### Configure the Sample Code Project

Simulator doesn’t support ARKit, so you can only run this sample on a physical device. This sample can run on Apple Vision Pro with visionOS 2 or later.
