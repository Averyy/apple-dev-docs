# testSuite(_:didFailWithDescription:inFile:atLine:)

**Framework**: XCTest  
**Kind**: method

Notifies the observer when a test suite reports a failure.

**Availability**:
- Unknown ?+ - Deprecated

## Declaration

```swift
optional func testSuite(_ testSuite: XCTestSuite, didFailWithDescription description: String, inFile filePath: String?, atLine lineNumber: Int)
```

#### Discussion

Suite failures are most commonly reported during suite-level setup and teardown. Failures during tests are reported for the test case alone and are not reported as suite failures.

## Parameters

- `testSuite`: The test suite that failed. Additional information about the suite can be retrieved from the test suite’s associated  .
- `description`: A textual description of the failure.
- `filePath`: The path to the file in the failure occurred, or   if the file path is unknown.
- `lineNumber`: The line number on which the failure was reported.
