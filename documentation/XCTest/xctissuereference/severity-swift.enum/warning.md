**Framework**: XCTest  
**Kind**: case

The severity level for an issue which should be noted but is not necessarily an error.

## Declaration

case warning
```

#### Discussion

An issue with warning severity does not cause the test it’s associated with to be marked as a failure, but is noted in the results.
