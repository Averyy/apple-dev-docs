# swizzle

**Framework**: Metal  
**Kind**: property

The pattern you want the GPU to apply to pixels when you read or sample pixels from the texture.

**Availability**:
- iOS 13.0+
- iPadOS 13.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- macOS 10.15+
- tvOS 13.0+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
var swizzle: MTLTextureSwizzleChannels { get set }
```

#### Discussion

The default value does not apply a transformation to pixels sampled or read from the texture.
