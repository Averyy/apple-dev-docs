# allowGPUOptimizedContents

**Framework**: Metal  
**Kind**: property

A Boolean value indicating whether the GPU is allowed to adjust the texture’s contents to improve GPU performance.

**Availability**:
- iOS 12.0+
- iPadOS 12.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- macOS 10.14+
- tvOS 12.0+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
var allowGPUOptimizedContents: Bool { get set }
```

## Mentions

#### Discussion

The default value is `true`, which means that the Metal device is allowed to adjust the private layout of the texture in memory to improve GPU performance. For a shared or managed texture, this optimization can cause slower performance when accessing the texture from the CPU. Setting this property to `false` improves CPU performance at the cost of some GPU performance.
