# copyAndCompact(sourceAccelerationStructure:destinationAccelerationStructure:)

**Framework**: Metal  
**Kind**: method  
**Required**: Yes

Encodes a command to compact an acceleration structure’s data and copy it into a different acceleration structure.

**Availability**:
- iOS 14.0+
- iPadOS 14.0+
- Mac Catalyst 14.0+
- macOS 11.0+
- tvOS 16.0+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
func copyAndCompact(sourceAccelerationStructure: any MTLAccelerationStructure, destinationAccelerationStructure: any MTLAccelerationStructure)
```

#### Discussion

The source and destination acceleration structures can’t overlap in memory. The destination acceleration structure needs to be at least as large as the compact size of the source acceleration structure, which you obtain by using the [`writeCompactedSize(accelerationStructure:buffer:offset:)`](mtlaccelerationstructurecommandencoder/writecompactedsize(accelerationstructure:buffer:offset:).md) method.

If the source acceleration structure contains references to other acceleration structures, the copy of the acceleration structure refers to the same child structures.

## Parameters

- `sourceAccelerationStructure`: The source acceleration structure.
- `destinationAccelerationStructure`: The destination acceleration structure.
