# peerGroupID

**Framework**: Metal  
**Kind**: property  
**Required**: Yes

The peer group ID the GPU belongs to, if applicable.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.15+

## Declaration

```swift
var peerGroupID: UInt64 { get }
```

## Mentions

#### Discussion

A group ID value of `0` indicates the GPU isn’t in a peer group. Otherwise, the GPU is in a peer group and the value is the group’s ID. All other GPUs in the same peer group have the same group ID.
