# peerCount

**Framework**: Metal  
**Kind**: property  
**Role**: Instance Property  
**Required**: Yes

The total number of GPUs in the peer group, if applicable.

**Availability**:
- macOS 10.15+ - Deprecated in 27.0

> **Deprecated**: Not applicable on Apple Silicon

## Declaration

```swift
var peerCount: UInt32 { get }
```

```objc
@property (readonly) uint32_t peerCount;
```

## Discussion

A peer count value of `0` indicates the GPU isn’t in a peer group. Otherwise, the GPU is in a peer group and the value represents the total number of GPUs in the group, including this one.
