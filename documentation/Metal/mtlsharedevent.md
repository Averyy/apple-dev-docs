#### Overview

The [`MTLSharedEvent`](mtlsharedevent.md) protocol inherits the [`MTLEvent`](mtlevent.md) protocol. An event can only synchronize memory operations that run on a single Metal device. A shared event can synchronize memory operations across multiple Metal devices and the CPU. Shared events work anywhere you can work with a regular event.

> 💡 **Tip**: Start with an [`MTLEvent`](mtlevent.md) instance until you need to synchronize work with a task that runs on the CPU or another Metal device, because an [`MTLSharedEvent`](mtlsharedevent.md) can add overhead that may affect your app’s performance.

Create an [`MTLSharedEvent`](mtlsharedevent.md) by calling the [`makeSharedEvent()`](mtldevice/makesharedevent().md) method of an [`MTLDevice`](mtldevice.md) instance.

To pass this event to another process:

1. Create a handle to the shared event by calling the [`makeSharedEventHandle()`](mtlsharedevent/makesharedeventhandle().md) method.
2. Transfer the handle to another process with XPC.
3. From the other process, call the [`makeSharedEvent(handle:)`](mtldevice/makesharedevent(handle:).md) method.

## Topics

### Synchronizing a shareable event
- [var signaledValue: UInt64](mtlsharedevent/signaledvalue.md)
  The current signal value for the shareable event.
- [func notify(MTLSharedEventListener, atValue: UInt64, block: MTLSharedEventNotificationBlock)](mtlsharedevent/notify(_:atvalue:block:).md)
  Schedules a notification handler to be called after the shareable event’s signal value equals or exceeds a given value.
### Creating a shared event handle
- [func makeSharedEventHandle() -> MTLSharedEventHandle](mtlsharedevent/makesharedeventhandle.md)
  Creates a new shareable event handle.
### Instance Methods
- [func valueSignaled(UInt64) async](mtlsharedevent/valuesignaled(_:).md)
- [func wait(untilSignaledValue: UInt64, timeoutMS: UInt64) -> Bool](mtlsharedevent/wait(untilsignaledvalue:timeoutms:).md)
