# executeCommandsInBuffer(_:range:)

**Framework**: Metal  
**Kind**: method

Encodes a command that runs a range of commands from an indirect command buffer (ICB).

**Availability**:
- iOS 12.0+
- iPadOS 12.0+
- Mac Catalyst ?+
- macOS 10.14+
- tvOS 12.0+
- visionOS ?+

## Declaration

```swift
func executeCommandsInBuffer(_ buffer: any MTLIndirectCommandBuffer, range: Range<Int>)
```

## Parameters

- `buffer`: An [`MTLIndirectCommandBuffer`](mtlindirectcommandbuffer.md) instance that contains other commands the current command runs.
- `range`: A span of integers that represent the command entries in `buffer` the current command runs. When running on Metal devices that belong to the [`MTLGPUFamily.mac2`](mtlgpufamily/mac2.md) GPU family, the number of commands needs to be less than or equal to 0x4000 (16,384). Metal devices that belong to an Apple silicon family, such as [`MTLGPUFamily.apple10`](mtlgpufamily/apple10.md), don’t have this limitation.
