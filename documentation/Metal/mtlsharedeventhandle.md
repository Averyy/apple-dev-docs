## Declaration

```swift
class MTLSharedEventHandle
```

#### Overview

To create a `MTLSharedEventHandle` instance, call the [`makeSharedEventHandle()`](mtlsharedevent/makesharedeventhandle().md) method on an [`MTLSharedEvent`](mtlsharedevent.md) instance. Use an XPC conection to pass a `MTLSharedEventHandle` instance to another process. To recreate the event, call the [`makeSharedEvent(handle:)`](mtldevice/makesharedevent(handle:).md) on an [`MTLDevice`](mtldevice.md) instance.

## Topics
