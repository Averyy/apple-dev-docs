# Modern rendering with Metal

**Framework**: Metal

Use advanced Metal features such as indirect command buffers, sparse textures, and variable rate rasterization to implement complex rendering techniques.

**Availability**:
- iOS 14.1+
- iPadOS 14.1+
- macOS 11.0+
- Xcode 13.0+

#### Overview

> **Note**: This sample code project is associated with the [`Metal Enhancements for A13 Bionic`](https://developer.apple.comhttp://developer.apple.com/tech-talks/608) tech talk.

##### Configure the Sample Code Project

Because this sample app uses indirect command buffers, you can’t run this sample in the Simulator — you need to run it on a device. To run this sample, use one of the following:

- A Mac from mid-2016 and later with macOS 11 and later
- An iPad with A11 Bionic and later using iPadOS 14.1 and later
- An iOS device with A11 Bionic and later using iOS 14.1 and later
- Xcode 12 and later
