#### Discussion

To determine whether this sprite is affected by being a shadow generated by a light, its [`shadowCastBitMask`](skspritenode/shadowcastbitmask.md) property is tested against the light’s [`categoryBitMask`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SceneKit/SCNLight/categoryBitMask) property by performing a logical AND operation. If the comparison results in a nonzero value, the sprite is drawn using a shadowed effect.

The default value is 0x00000000 (all bits cleared).
