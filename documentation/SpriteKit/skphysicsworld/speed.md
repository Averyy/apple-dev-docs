# speed

**Framework**: SpriteKit  
**Kind**: property  
**Role**: Instance Property

The rate at which the simulation executes.

**Availability**:
- iOS
- iPadOS
- Mac Catalyst
- macOS
- tvOS
- visionOS
- watchOS

## Declaration

```swift
var speed: CGFloat { get set }
```

```objc
@property (nonatomic) CGFloat speed;
```

## Discussion

The default value is `1.0`, which means the simulation runs at normal speed. A value other than the default changes the rate at which time passes in the physics simulation. For example, a speed value of `2.0` indicates that time in the physics simulation passes twice as fast as the scene’s simulation time. A value of `0.0` pauses the physics simulation.
