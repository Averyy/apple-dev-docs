# SKRepeatMode.clamp

**Framework**: SpriteKit  
**Kind**: case

When a sample is calculated, the time value is clamped to the range of time values found in the sequence. For example, if the last keyframe’s time value is `0.5`, a sample at any time value from `0.5` to `1.0` returns the last keyframe’s value.

## Declaration

```swift
case clamp
```

#### Discussion

Given a sequence with the key values of `[5, 1, 10]` and times of `[0, 0.25, 0.5]`, clamp repeat mode produces a set of values that follow straight line when the sample time is greater or equal to `0.5`:

  When a sample is calculated, the sequence loops back to the beginning of the sequence. For example, if the last keyframe’s time value is `0.5`, then a sample at any time value from `0.5` to `1.0` returns the same value as the sequence did from `0.0` to `0.5`.
