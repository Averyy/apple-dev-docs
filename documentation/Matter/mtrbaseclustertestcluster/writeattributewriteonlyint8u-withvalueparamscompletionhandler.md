> **Note**:  You can call this method from synchronous code using a completion handler, as shown on this page, or you can call it as an asynchronous method that has the following declaration: ```swift
func writeAttributeWriteOnlyInt8u(withValue value: NSNumber, params: MTRWriteParams?) async throws
``` For information about concurrency and asynchronous code in Swift, see [`Calling Objective-C APIs Asynchronously`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/calling-objective-c-apis-asynchronously).
