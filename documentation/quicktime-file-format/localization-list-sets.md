# Localization list sets

**Framework**: QuickTime File Format

Provide metadata for more than one country or language.

#### Overview

When metadata items have individual values associated with more than one country or more than one language, a country list atom and/or language list atom are required. Alternatively, if all values are associated with zero or one country, no country list atom is required, and if all values are associated with zero or one language, no language list atom is required.
