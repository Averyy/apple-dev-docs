# About this appendix

**Framework**: QuickTime File Format

#### Overview

The technical content of this appendix begins with a discussion of the structure of the profile atom, which holds an array of feature codes and values. Next is an enumeration of the currently included profile features, each described in a feature description section.

The responsibilities placed upon a writer of a movie (such as QuickTime or a consumer electronics (CE) device) are described in the feature’s Writer Responsibilities section. A description of the algorithm to be used to calculate values is provided.

The feature’s Reader Responsibilities section explains how reading software should interpret the value. In some cases, there are warnings to indicate how the reader must not use the value (for example, not interpreting the maximum bit rate value as the current bit rate).
