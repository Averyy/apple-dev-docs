# Samples per packet

**Framework**: QuickTime File Format  
**Kind**: property

The number of uncompressed frames generated by a compressed frame, where an uncompressed frame is one sample from each channel.

#### Overview

This is also the frame duration, expressed in the media’s timescale, where the timescale is equal to the sample rate. For uncompressed formats, this field is always `1`.
