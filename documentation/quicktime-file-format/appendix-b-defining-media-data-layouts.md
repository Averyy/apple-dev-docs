# Defining media data layouts

**Framework**: QuickTime File Format

Use efficient media layouts.

#### Overview

The QuickTime file format provides a great deal of flexibility in how media data is physically arranged within a file. However, it also allows media layouts to be created that may be inefficient for playback on a given device. To complicate the matter, a media layout that is inefficient for one device may be, in fact, very efficient for another. Review [`Using QuickTime files and media layouts`](using_quicktime_files_and_media_layouts.md) for some common uses of QuickTime files and media layouts in these circumstances.
