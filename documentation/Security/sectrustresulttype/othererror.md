## Declaration

```swift
case otherError
```

```c
kSecTrustResultOtherError
```

#### Discussion

This value indicates that evaluation failed for some other reason. This can be caused by either a revoked certificate or by OS-level errors that are unrelated to the certificates themselves.

You might receive the [`SecTrustResultType.otherError`](./othererror.md) value after an evaluation, but you can’t store the value as part of the user trust settings with a call to the [`SecTrustSettingsSetTrustSettings(_:_:_:)`](../sectrustsettingssettrustsettings%28_,_,_%29.md) method.
