# SSLReadFunc

**Framework**: Security  
**Kind**: typealias

A pointer to a customized read function that secure transport calls to read data from the connection.

**Availability**:
- Mac Catalyst 13.0+
- macOS 10.0+

## Declaration

```swift
typealias SSLReadFunc = (SSLConnectionRef, UnsafeMutableRawPointer, UnsafeMutablePointer<Int>) -> OSStatus
```

## Mentions

#### Return Value

Your callback must return an appropriate result code. See [`Secure Transport Result Codes`](secure-transport-result-codes.md).

#### Discussion

Before using the secure transport API, you must create a read function (conforming to the [`SSLReadFunc`](sslreadfunc.md) prototype) and a write function (conforming to  the [`SSLWriteFunc`](sslwritefunc.md) prototype) and provide them to the library by calling the [`SSLSetIOFuncs(_:_:_:)`](sslsetiofuncs(_:_:_:).md) function.

You may configure the underlying connection to operate in a non-blocking manner; in that case, a read operation may well return [`errSSLWouldBlock`](errsslwouldblock.md), indicating less data than requested was transferred and nothing is wrong except that the requested I/O hasn’t completed. This result is returned to the caller from the functions [`SSLRead(_:_:_:_:)`](sslread(_:_:_:_:).md), [`SSLWrite(_:_:_:_:)`](sslwrite(_:_:_:_:).md), or [`SSLHandshake(_:)`](sslhandshake(_:).md).

## Parameters

- `connection`: A connection reference.
- `data`: On return, your callback should overwrite the memory at this location with the data read from the connection.
- `dataLength`: On input, a pointer to an integer representing the length of the data in bytes. On return, your callback should overwrite that integer with the number of bytes actually transferred.
