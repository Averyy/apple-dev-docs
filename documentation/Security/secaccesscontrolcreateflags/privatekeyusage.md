#### Discussion

This option can be combined with any other access control flags.

You typically use this constraint when you create a key pair and store the private key inside a device’s Secure Enclave (by specifying the [`kSecAttrTokenID`](ksecattrtokenid.md) attribute with a value of [`kSecAttrTokenIDSecureEnclave`](ksecattrtokenidsecureenclave.md)). This makes the private key available for use in signing and verification tasks that happen inside the Secure Enclave with calls to the [`SecKeyRawSign(_:_:_:_:_:_:)`](seckeyrawsign(_:_:_:_:_:_:).md) and [`SecKeyRawVerify(_:_:_:_:_:_:)`](seckeyrawverify(_:_:_:_:_:_:).md) functions. An attempt to use this constraint while generating a key pair outside the Secure Enclave fails. Similarly, an attempt to sign a block with a private key generated without this constraint inside the Secure Enclave fails.
