- iPadOS 11.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+

## Declaration

```swift
static let noseSneerRight: ARFaceAnchor.BlendShapeLocation
```

#### Discussion

The figure below shows a face geometry (see [`ARSCNFaceGeometry`](arscnfacegeometry.md)) in two states, demonstrating values of `0.0` and `1.0` for this coefficient. In both states, the values for all other [`ARFaceAnchor.BlendShapeLocation`](arfaceanchor/blendshapelocation.md) coefficients are set to `0.0`.
