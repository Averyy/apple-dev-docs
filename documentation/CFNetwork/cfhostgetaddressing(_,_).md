## Declaration

```swift
func CFHostGetAddressing(_ theHost: CFHost, _ hasBeenResolved: UnsafeMutablePointer<DarwinBoolean>?) -> Unmanaged<CFArray>?
```

```c
extern CFArrayRefCFHostGetAddressing(CFHostRef theHost, Boolean *hasBeenResolved);
```

#### Discussion

This function gets the addresses from a CFHost. The CFHost must have been previously resolved. To resolve a CFHost, call [`CFHostStartInfoResolution(_:_:_:)`](./cfhoststartinforesolution%28_,_,_%29.md).

##### Special Considerations

This function gets the addresses in a thread-safe way, but the resulting data is not thread-safe. The data is returned as a “get” as opposed to a copy, so the data is not safe if the CFHost is altered from another thread.

## Parameters

- `theHost`: The CFHost whose addresses are to be obtained. This value must not be `NULL`.
- `hasBeenResolved`: On return, a pointer to a Boolean that is `TRUE` if addresses were available and `FALSE` if addresses were not available. This parameter can be null.
