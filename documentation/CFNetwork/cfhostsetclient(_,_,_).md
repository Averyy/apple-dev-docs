# CFHostSetClient(_:_:_:)

**Framework**: CFNetwork  
**Kind**: func  
**Role**: Function

Associates a client context and a callback function with a CFHost object or disassociates a client context and callback function that were previously set.

**Availability**:
- iOS 2.0+ - Deprecated in 27.0
- iPadOS 2.0+ - Deprecated in 27.0
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+ - Deprecated in 27.0
- macOS 10.3+ - Deprecated in 27.0

## Declaration

```swift
func CFHostSetClient(_ theHost: CFHost, _ clientCB: CFHostClientCallBack?, _ clientContext: UnsafeMutablePointer<CFHostClientContext>?) -> Bool
```

```c
extern Boolean CFHostSetClient(CFHostRef theHost, CFHostClientCallBack clientCB, CFHostClientContext *clientContext);
```

## Return Value

`TRUE` if the association could be set or unset, otherwise `FALSE`.

## Discussion

The callback function specified by `clientCB` will be called when a resolution completes or is cancelled.

### Special Considerations

This function is thread safe.

## Parameters

- `theHost`: The host to modify. The value must not be `NULL`.
- `clientCB`: The callback function to associate with `theHost`. The callback function will be called when a resolution completes or is cancelled. If you are calling this function to disassociate a client context and callback from `theHost`, p`clientCB`ass `NULL`.
- `clientContext`: A [`CFHostClientContext`](./cfhostclientcontext.md) structure whose `info` field will be passed to the callback function specified by `clientCB` when `clientCB` is called. This value must not be `NULL` when setting an association.

  Pass `NULL` when disassociating a client context and a callback from a host.
