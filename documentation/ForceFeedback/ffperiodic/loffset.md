## Declaration

```swift
var lOffset: LONG
```

- [var dwMagnitude: DWORD](ffperiodic/dwmagnitude.md)
  Magnitude of the effect, in the range from 0 through 10,000. If an envelope is applied to this effect, the value represents the magnitude of the sustain. If no envelope is applied, the value represents the amplitude of the entire effect.
- [var dwPeriod: DWORD](ffperiodic/dwperiod.md)
  Period of the effect, in microseconds.
- [var dwPhase: DWORD](ffperiodic/dwphase.md)
  Position in the cycle of the periodic effect at which playback begins, in the range from 0 through 35,999.
