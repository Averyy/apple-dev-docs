# dwMagnitude

**Framework**: Force Feedback  
**Kind**: property

Magnitude of the effect, in the range from 0 through 10,000. If an envelope is applied to this effect, the value represents the magnitude of the sustain. If no envelope is applied, the value represents the amplitude of the entire effect.

**Availability**:
- Mac Catalyst 13.0+
- macOS 10.2+

## Declaration

```swift
var dwMagnitude: DWORD
```

## See Also

- [var dwPeriod: DWORD](ffperiodic/dwperiod.md)
  Period of the effect, in microseconds.
- [var dwPhase: DWORD](ffperiodic/dwphase.md)
  Position in the cycle of the periodic effect at which playback begins, in the range from 0 through 35,999.
- [var lOffset: LONG](ffperiodic/loffset.md)
  Offset of the effect. The range of forces generated by the effect is  minus  to  plus . The value of the  member is also the baseline for any envelope that is applied to the effect.
