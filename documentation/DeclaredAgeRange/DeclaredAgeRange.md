#### Overview

Use the DeclaredAgeRange framework to request people to share their age range with your app. For children and teens in a family, a parent or guardian can decide whether to always share a child’s age information, ask every time, or never share their age information. Along with an age range, the system returns an [`AgeRangeService.AgeRangeDeclaration`](agerangeservice/agerangedeclaration.md) for the age range a person provides.
