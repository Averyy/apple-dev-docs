Types of chair legs the framework identifies in a captured room.

**Availability**:
- iOS 17.0+

## Declaration

```swift
enum ChairLegType
```

#### Overview

When the framework observes a chair in the physical environment during a scan, it chooses a type among these options that best matches the look of the chair’s legs. The framework adds that instance of this enum to the [`attributes`](capturedroom/object/attributes.md) array for the object (see [`objects`](capturedroom/objects.md)) that represents the chair in the captured room.
