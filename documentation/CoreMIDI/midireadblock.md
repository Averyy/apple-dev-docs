# MIDIReadBlock

**Framework**: Core MIDI  
**Kind**: typealias

A block receiving MIDI input.

**Availability**:
- iOS 9.0+
- iPadOS 9.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- macOS 10.11+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
typealias MIDIReadBlock = (UnsafePointer<MIDIPacketList>, UnsafeMutableRawPointer?) -> Void
```

#### Discussion

This is a callback block through which a client receives incoming MIDI messages.

A MIDIReadBlock is passed to the MIDIInputPortCreateWithBlock and MIDIDestinationCreateWithBlock functions. The CoreMIDI framework will create a high-priority receive thread on your client’s behalf, and from that thread, your MIDIReadProc will be called when incoming MIDI messages arrive.

## Parameters

- `pktlist`: The incoming MIDI message(s).
- `srcConnRefCon`: A refCon you passed to MIDIPortConnectSource, which identifies the source of the data.
