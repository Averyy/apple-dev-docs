# MIDISourceCreate(_:_:_:)

**Framework**: Core MIDI  
**Kind**: func

Creates a virtual source in a client.

**Availability**:
- iOS 4.2+
- iPadOS 4.2+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- macOS 10.0+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
func MIDISourceCreate(_ client: MIDIClientRef, _ name: CFString, _ outSrc: UnsafeMutablePointer<MIDIEndpointRef>) -> OSStatus
```

#### Return Value

An OSStatus result code.

#### Discussion

Drivers need not call this; when they create devices and entities, sources and destinations are created at that time.

After creating a virtual source, use MIDIReceived to transmit MIDI messages from your virtual source to any clients connected to the virtual source.

After creating a virtual source, it’s a good idea to assign it the same unique ID it had the last time your application created it. (Although you should be prepared for this to fail in the unlikely event of a collision.) This will permit other clients to retain persistent references to your virtual source more easily.

## Parameters

- `client`: The client owning the virtual source.
- `name`: The name of the virtual source.
- `outSrc`: On successful return, a pointer to the newly-created source.
