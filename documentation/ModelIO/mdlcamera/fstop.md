#### Discussion

Relative aperture, also called  or , is a measure of the amount of light permitted through a lens to an imaging surface, commonly thought of as the “speed” of the lens. The f-stop is the ratio of the lens’s [`focalLength`](mdlcamera/focallength.md) to the diameter of the entrance pupil. It controls the amount of light that reaches the sensor, as well as the size of out-of-focus parts of the image.

The default relative aperture is is `5.6`, simulating an f/5.6 lens.
