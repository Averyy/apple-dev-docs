# focalLength

**Framework**: Model I/O  
**Kind**: property

The focal length, in millimeters, of the camera’s simulated lens.

**Availability**:
- iOS 9.0+
- iPadOS 9.0+

## Declaration

```swift
var focalLength: Float { get set }
```

#### Discussion

In a physically based camera, field of view is based on the focal length of the lens and the vertical aperture of the imaging surface (film or sensor). Changing the [`focalLength`](mdlcamera/focallength.md) or [`sensorVerticalAperture`](mdlcamera/sensorverticalaperture.md) property updates the [`fieldOfView`](mdlcamera/fieldofview.md) property to the corresponding value, and vice versa.

The default focal length is 50mm, corresponding to a field of view of 54 degrees, and vertical sensor aperture of 24mm.
