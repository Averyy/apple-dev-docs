# boundingBox

**Framework**: Model I/O  
**Kind**: property  
**Role**: Instance Property

The minimum region entirely enclosing the asset’s contents.

**Availability**:

## Declaration

```swift
var boundingBox: MDLAxisAlignedBoundingBox { get }
```

```objc
@property (nonatomic, readonly) MDLAxisAlignedBoundingBox boundingBox;
```

#### Discussion

If an asset contains timed information, such as animated mesh data, this property provides the asset’s bounding box as of the first time sample. Use the [`boundingBox(atTime:)`](./boundingbox%28attime%29.md) method to get bounding box information at a specific time sample.

All assets can provide bounding box information without traversing their hierarchy of objects.
