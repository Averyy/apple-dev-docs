## Declaration

```swift
func gss_inquire_names_for_mech(_ minor_status: UnsafeMutablePointer<OM_uint32>, _ mechanism: gss_const_OID, _ name_types: UnsafeMutablePointer<gss_OID_set?>) -> OM_uint32
```

#### Return Value

A status code set to [`GSS_S_COMPLETE`](gss_s_complete.md) on success. See [`Function Status`](function-status.md) for a complete enumeration of status outputs.

## Parameters

- `minor_status`: A pointer to the secondary status result that provides additional information in case of failure.
- `mechanism`: The mechanism to examine.
- `name_types`: A pointer the function uses to return a set of object identifiers that correspond to the name types that the mechanism supports.
