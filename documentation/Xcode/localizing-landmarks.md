Add localizations to the Landmarks sample code project.

**Availability**:

#### Overview

This is an unlocalized version of [`Landmarks`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/landmarks-building-an-app-with-liquid-glass). Prepare it for localization by adding a String Catalog and import translations (`de.xcloc`) to complete the localization process.

> **Note**: This sample code project is associated with WWDC25 session 225: [`Code-along: Explore localization with Xcode`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/225).
