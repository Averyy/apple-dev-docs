# Xcode

**Framework**: Xcode

Build, test, and submit your app with Apple’s integrated development environment.

#### Overview

Xcode is the suite of tools you use to build apps for Apple platforms. Use Xcode to manage your entire development workflow — from creating your app to testing, optimizing, and submitting it to the App Store.

Xcode includes a world-class source editor with code completion, source control, and a powerful debugger. Use coding intelligence to explain and write code, analyze bugs, and generate fixes. Add playground macros to run code snippets, and add SwiftUI previews to see your UI as you build it.

Xcode also includes several tools to help you rapidly develop and test your app:

- Run your entire app in Simulator without using a real device.
- Create a single, multilayer icon for your app using the Icon Composer app.
- Use Instruments to profile and analyze your app, improve performance, and investigate system resource usage.
- Construct 3D content with Reality Composer.
- Train custom machine learning models with Create ML.
- Identify areas of your app that aren’t accessible with Accessibility Inspector.

> **Note**: Download the latest version of Xcode from the [`Mac App Store`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835). Download beta versions of Xcode from the [`Apple Developer website`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
