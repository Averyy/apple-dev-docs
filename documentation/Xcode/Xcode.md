# Xcode

**Framework**: Xcode

Build, test, and submit your app with Apple’s integrated development environment.

#### Overview

Xcode is a suite of tools developers use to build apps for Apple platforms. Use Xcode to manage your entire development workflow — from creating your app to testing, optimizing, and submitting it to the App Store.

Xcode includes a world-class code editor, built in SwiftUI preview tools that show the UI of your app as you modify code, and a powerful debugger with conditional breakpoints.

Xcode also includes several development tools to help you rapidly prototype and test your app. Use Simulator for rapid prototyping and testing your app in a simulated environment when a real device isn’t available. Use Instruments to profile and analyze your app, improve performance, and investigate system resource usage. Construct 3D content with Reality Composer, train custom machine learning models with Create ML, and identify areas of your app that aren’t accessible with Accessibility Inspector.

> **Note**: Download the latest version of Xcode from the [`Mac App Store`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835). Download beta versions of Xcode from the [`Apple Developer website`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
