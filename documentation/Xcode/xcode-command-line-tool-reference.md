# Xcode command-line tool reference

**Framework**: Xcode

Use command-line tools that require you to install Xcode and set the app as the active developer directory.

#### Overview

Xcode includes a set of command-line tools that only ship with the app, such as `devicectl`, `simctl`, and `xcodebuild`. You must install and set Xcode as the active developer directory before you can invoke these commands in Terminal.

> **Note**: For more information on accessing the command-line tools documentation, see [`Reading UNIX Manual Pages`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/reading-unix-manual-pages).
