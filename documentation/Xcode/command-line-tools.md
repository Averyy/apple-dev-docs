# Command-line tools

**Framework**: Xcode

Develop and customize your projects in Terminal.

#### Overview

You can use command-line tools to perform some actions in Terminal without running Xcode. For example, you can develop your open source or cross-platform projects, notarize your macOS software, automate your builds, implement continuous integration, and apply specific settings to your projects.
