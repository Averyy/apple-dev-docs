# Invalid float cast

**Framework**: Xcode

Detects out-of-range casts to, from, or between floating-point types.

#### Overview

Use this check to detect out-of-range casts to, from, or between floating-point types. Invalid casts have undefined behavior, and typically yield arbitrary values. These values may differ from platform to platform. Available in Xcode 9 and later.

##### Invalid Assignment of a Double to a Float in C

The cast from `n` to `m` results in undefined behavior because the destination type can’t represent its value.

```occ
double n = 10e50;
float m = (float)n; // Error: 10e50 can't be represented as a float.
```

###### Solution

Use a different destination type or avoid the cast altogether.
