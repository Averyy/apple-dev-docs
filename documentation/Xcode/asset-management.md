# Asset management

**Framework**: Xcode

Add app icons, images, strings, data files, machine learning models, and other resources to your projects, and manage how you load them at runtime.

#### Overview

Apps rely on many types of assets to create a rich, dynamic, and visually engaging user experience. Xcode provides tools and settings to help you add, organize, and optimize the different asset types your app uses.

Xcode simplifies managing most types of assets with asset catalogs. Use  to organize and manage resources such as images, colors, app icons, textures, stickers, and data.

Xcode also provides interactive editors for certain types of assets, like particle effects, that let you experiment, make changes, and see the results immediately.
