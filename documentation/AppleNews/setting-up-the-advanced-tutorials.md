# Setting Up the Advanced Tutorials

**Framework**: Apple News

Download the tutorial files, and learn about what you’ll create in the three advanced tutorials.

#### Overview

These three advanced tutorials will help you use some of the advanced design and layout features of Apple News Format. For information on previewing the article bundle examples and choosing a text editor, see [`Setting Up the Introductory Tutorial`](setting-up-the-introductory-tutorial.md).

The images below show some of the design and layout features of Apple News Format, such as inset components and inline HTML styling. You’ll use these features in the tutorials that follow to build your own designs and layouts, and Apple News will adapt your layouts to any iOS, iPadOS, or macOS device.

##### Header Techniques

The first advanced tutorial covers some techniques for designing the header of your article.
