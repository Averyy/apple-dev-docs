#### Overview

The [`CLBeacon`](clbeacon.md) class represents a beacon that was observed during beacon ranging. You do not create instances of this class directly. The location manager ([`CLLocationManager`](cllocationmanager.md)) object reports observed beacons to its associated delegate object.

The identity of a beacon is defined by its [`uuid`](clbeacon/uuid.md), [`major`](clbeacon/major.md), and [`minor`](clbeacon/minor.md) properties. These values are coded into the beacon itself. For a more thorough description of the meaning of those values, see [`CLBeaconRegion`](clbeaconregion.md).

## Topics

### Getting the beacon identity
- [var uuid: UUID](clbeacon/uuid.md)
  The UUID that the observed beacon transmitted.
- [var major: NSNumber](clbeacon/major.md)
  The major value that the observed beacon transmitted.
- [var minor: NSNumber](clbeacon/minor.md)
  The minor value that the observed beacon transmitted.
- [var proximityUUID: UUID](clbeacon/proximityuuid.md)
  The proximity ID of the beacon.
### Determining the distance to the beacon
- [var proximity: CLProximity](clbeacon/proximity.md)
  The relative distance to the beacon.
- [enum CLProximity](clproximity.md)
  Constants that reflect the relative distance to a beacon.
- [var accuracy: CLLocationAccuracy](clbeacon/accuracy.md)
  The accuracy of the proximity value, measured in meters from the beacon.
- [var rssi: Int](clbeacon/rssi.md)
  The received signal strength of the beacon, measured in decibels.
### Getting the observation timestamp
- [var timestamp: Date](clbeacon/timestamp.md)
  A timestamp representing when the beacon was observed.
