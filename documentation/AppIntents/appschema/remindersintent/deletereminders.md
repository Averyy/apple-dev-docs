#### Discussion

To make your app’s actions available to Apple Intelligence, conform your [`AppIntent`](appintent.md) to a schema that describes your action to the system. If your app’s functionality aligns with the `reminders` domain and one of your app’s actions matches the `deleteReminders` schema, you can generate the properties and protocol conformance the schema requires for your intent implementation with the `@AppIntent( .reminders.deleteReminders)` Swift macro. To make your app work with Siri, see [`Apple Intelligence and Siri AI`](apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai.md).

The following example shows an intent that conforms to the `deleteReminders` schema:

```swift
@AppIntent(schema: .reminders.deleteReminders)
struct DeleteRemindersIntent: DeleteIntent {
    var entities: [<#ReminderEntity#>]

    func perform() async throws -> some IntentResult {
        <#code#>
    }
}
```

The schema supports the following system experiences:

- Siri
- Shortcuts
