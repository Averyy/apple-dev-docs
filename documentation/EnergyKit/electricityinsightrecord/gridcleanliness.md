#### Overview

The [`ElectricityInsightRecord`](electricityinsightrecord.md) structure’s [`dataByGridCleanliness`](electricityinsightrecord/databygridcleanliness.md) property returns electricity usage by the categories that this structure defines.

The type of electricity usage that this structure stores depends on the generic type parameter of a given [`ElectricityInsightMeasure`](electricityinsightmeasure.md) instance. If the generic type is:

### Initializing the grid data
- [init(cleaner: Measure?, lessClean: Measure?, avoid: Measure?, unknown: Measure?)](electricityinsightrecord/gridcleanliness/init(cleaner:lessclean:avoid:unknown:).md)
  Initializes the collection of grid cleanliness data.
### Getting grid cleanliness information
- [var cleaner: Measure?](electricityinsightrecord/gridcleanliness/cleaner.md)
  A category for electricity usage during the cleanest grid periods.
- [var lessClean: Measure?](electricityinsightrecord/gridcleanliness/lessclean.md)
  A category for electricity usage during less-clean grid periods.
- [var avoid: Measure?](electricityinsightrecord/gridcleanliness/avoid.md)
  A category for electricity usage during periods that the framework suggests a person avoid.
- [var unknown: Measure?](electricityinsightrecord/gridcleanliness/unknown.md)
  A category of electricity usage when grid cleanliness information is unavailable.
