# Reality Composer Pro

**Framework**: Reality Composer Pro

Build, create, and design 3D content for your RealityKit apps.

#### Overview

Reality Composer Pro provides a collection of tools and editors you can use to build interactive 3D content for your RealityKit apps. With Reality Composer Pro, you can create complex scenes composed of multiple assets — including audio files, 3D models, particle effects, lighting, and animations.

The top section has three views: a navigator view of content in the scene, a viewport in the middle showing a 3D model of a beach with additional assets, and an inspector on the right. The bottom section has four tabs, labeled Project Browser, Shader Graph, Timelines Audio Mixer, and Statistics. Project Browser is selected, and it’s also divided into three sections with a hierarchy on the left, a grid of icons in the middle, and an inspector on the right showing the entity hierarchy for the asset selected in the middle.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/2d56df1663f7d8dc8eae74cb210c60da/RCPro-HeroShot%402x.png)

Reality Composer Pro also includes multiple editors to help you import and manage assets in your project, design complex materials with Shader Graph, create animations, and optimize the performance of your content.
