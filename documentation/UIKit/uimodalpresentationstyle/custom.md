#### Discussion

All of these objects are provided by the presented view controller’s transitioning delegate, which is an object that conforms to the [`UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate`](uiviewcontrollertransitioningdelegate.md) protocol. Before presenting a view controller using this style, set the view controller’s  [`transitioningDelegate`](uiviewcontroller/transitioningdelegate.md) property to your custom transitioning delegate.
