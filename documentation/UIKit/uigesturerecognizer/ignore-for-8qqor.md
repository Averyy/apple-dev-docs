# ignore(_:for:)

**Framework**: UIKit  
**Kind**: method

Tells the gesture recognizer to ignore a specific press of the given event.

**Availability**:
- iOS 9.0+
- iPadOS 9.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- tvOS 9.0+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
func ignore(_ button: UIPress, for event: UIPressesEvent)
```

#### Discussion

If a button press isn’t part of this gesture you may pass it to this method, causing it to be ignored. `UIGestureRecognizer` does not cancel ignored presses on the associated view even if [`cancelsTouchesInView`](uigesturerecognizer/cancelstouchesinview.md) is [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true). This method is intended to be called, not overridden.

## Parameters

- `button`: A   object that is part of the current button press event and associated with  .
- `event`: A   object that includes a reference to  .
