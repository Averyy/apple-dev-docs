# canBePrevented(by:)

**Framework**: UIKit  
**Kind**: method

Overridden to indicate that the specified gesture recognizer can prevent the receiver from recognizing a gesture.

**Availability**:
- iOS ?+
- iPadOS ?+
- Mac Catalyst ?+
- tvOS ?+
- visionOS ?+

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
func canBePrevented(by preventingGestureRecognizer: UIGestureRecognizer) -> Bool
```

#### Return Value

[`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) to indicate that `preventingGestureRecognizer` can block the receiver from recognizing its gesture, otherwise [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false).

#### Discussion

Overriding these methods enables the same behavior as implementing the [`UIGestureRecognizerDelegate`](uigesturerecognizerdelegate.md) methods [`gestureRecognizerShouldBegin(_:)`](uigesturerecognizerdelegate/gesturerecognizershouldbegin(_:).md) and [`gestureRecognizer(_:shouldReceive:)`](uigesturerecognizerdelegate/gesturerecognizer(_:shouldreceive:)-16fuh.md). However, by overriding them, subclasses can define class-wide prevention rules. For example, a [`UITapGestureRecognizer`](uitapgesturerecognizer.md) object never prevents another `UITapGestureRecognizer` object with a higher tap count.

## Parameters

- `preventingGestureRecognizer`: An instance of a subclass of  .
