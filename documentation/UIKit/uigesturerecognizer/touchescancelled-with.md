# touchesCancelled(_:with:)

**Framework**: UIKit  
**Kind**: method

Sent to the gesture recognizer when a system event (such as an incoming phone call) cancels a touch event.

**Availability**:

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
func touchesCancelled(_ touches: Set<UITouch>, with event: UIEvent)
```

#### Discussion

This method has the same exact signature as the corresponding one declared by [`UIResponder`](uiresponder.md). Through this method a gesture recognizer receives touch objects (in their [`UITouch.Phase.cancelled`](uitouch/phase-swift.enum/cancelled.md) phase) before the view attached to the gesture recognizer receives them. `UIGestureRecognizer` objects are not in the responder chain, yet observe touches hit-tested to their view and their view’s subviews. After observation, the delivery of touch objects to the attached view, or their disposition otherwise, is affected by the [`cancelsTouchesInView`](uigesturerecognizer/cancelstouchesinview.md), [`delaysTouchesBegan`](uigesturerecognizer/delaystouchesbegan.md), and [`delaysTouchesEnded`](uigesturerecognizer/delaystouchesended.md) properties.

Upon receiving this message, the gesture recognizer for a continuous gesture should set its state to [`UIGestureRecognizer.State.cancelled`](uigesturerecognizer/state-swift.enum/cancelled.md); a gesture recognizer for a discrete gesture should set its state to [`UIGestureRecognizer.State.failed`](uigesturerecognizer/state-swift.enum/failed.md).

## Parameters

- `touches`: A set of   instances in the event represented by   that represent the touches in the   phase.
- `event`: A   object representing the event to which the touches belong.
