# activeAppearance

**Framework**: UIKit  
**Kind**: property

A property that indicates whether the user interface has an active appearance.

**Availability**:

- iPadOS 14.0+
- Mac Catalyst 14.0+
- tvOS 14.0+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
var activeAppearance: UIUserInterfaceActiveAppearance { get }
```

#### Discussion

The active appearance varies by platform and window management mode. On macOS, Stage Manager on iPad, and Windowed mode on iPad, the value is `.active` when at least one window is in the foreground and `.inactive` when no windows are in the foreground. On iOS and Full Screen mode on iPad, the value reflects whether the app itself is in the foreground (`.active`) or not (`.inactive`).
