# UIKit Dynamics

**Framework**: UIKit

Apply physics-based animations to your views.

## Topics

### Dynamic animators
- [class UIDynamicAnimator](uidynamicanimator.md)
  An object that provides physics-related capabilities and animations for its dynamic items, and provides the context for those animations.
### Dynamic Items
- [protocol UIDynamicItem](uidynamicitem.md)
  A set of methods that can make a custom object eligible to participate in UIKit Dynamics.
- [class UIDynamicItemBehavior](uidynamicitembehavior.md)
  A base dynamic animation configuration for one or more dynamic items.
- [class UIDynamicItemGroup](uidynamicitemgroup.md)
  A dynamic item that comprises multiple other dynamic items.
### Behaviors
- [class UIDynamicBehavior](uidynamicbehavior.md)
  An object that confers a behavioral configuration on one or more dynamic items, for their participation in 2D animation.
- [class UIAttachmentBehavior](uiattachmentbehavior.md)
  A relationship between two dynamic items, or between a dynamic item and an anchor point.
- [class UICollisionBehavior](uicollisionbehavior.md)
  An object that confers to a specified array of dynamic items the ability to engage in collisions with each other and with the behavior’s specified boundaries.
- [class UIFieldBehavior](uifieldbehavior.md)
  An object that applies field-based physics to dynamic items.
- [class UIGravityBehavior](uigravitybehavior.md)
  An object that applies a gravity-like force to all of its associated dynamic items.
- [class UIPushBehavior](uipushbehavior.md)
  A behavior that applies a continuous or instantaneous force to one or more dynamic items, causing those items to change position accordingly.
- [class UISnapBehavior](uisnapbehavior.md)
  A spring-like behavior whose initial motion is damped over time so that the object settles at a specific point.
### Animation regions
- [class UIRegion](uiregion.md)
  A shape for use in UIKit Dynamics.
