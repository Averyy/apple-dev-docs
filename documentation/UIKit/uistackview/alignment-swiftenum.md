- [UIStackView.Alignment.center](uistackview/alignment-swift.enum/center.md)
  A layout where the stack view aligns the center of its arranged views with its center along its axis.
- [UIStackView.Alignment.leading](uistackview/alignment-swift.enum/leading.md)
  A layout for vertical stacks where the stack view aligns the leading edge of its arranged views along its leading edge.
- [UIStackView.Alignment.trailing](uistackview/alignment-swift.enum/trailing.md)
  A layout for vertical stacks where the stack view aligns the trailing edge of its arranged views along its trailing edge.
- [static var top: UIStackView.Alignment](uistackview/alignment-swift.enum/top.md)
