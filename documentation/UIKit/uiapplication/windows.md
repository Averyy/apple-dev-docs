## Declaration

#### Discussion

This property contains the [`UIWindow`](uiwindow.md) objects currently associated with the app. This list doesn’t include windows created and managed by the system, such as the window used to display the status bar.

The array orders the windows from back to front by window level; thus, the last window in the array is on top of all other app windows.
