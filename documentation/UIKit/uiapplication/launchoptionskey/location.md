#### Discussion

The value of this key is an [`NSNumber`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSNumber) object containing a Boolean value. You should use the presence of this key as a signal to create a [`CLLocationManager`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreLocation/CLLocationManager) object and start location services again. Location data is delivered only to the location manager delegate and not using this key.
