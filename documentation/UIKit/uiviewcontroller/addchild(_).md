# addChild(_:)

**Framework**: UIKit  
**Kind**: method  
**Role**: Instance Method

Adds the specified view controller as a child of the current view controller.

- tvOS
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
func addChild(_ childController: UIViewController)
```

```objc
- (void) addChildViewController:(UIViewController *) childController;
```

## Mentions

- [Creating a custom container view controller](../creating-a-custom-container-view-controller.md)

## Discussion

This method creates a parent-child relationship between the current view controller and the object in the `childController` parameter. This relationship is necessary when embedding the child view controller’s view into the current view controller’s content. If the new child view controller is already the child of a container view controller, it is removed from that container before being added.

This method is only intended to be called by an implementation of a custom container view controller. If you override this method, you must call `super` in your implementation.

## Parameters

- `childController`: The view controller to be added as a child.
