#### Discussion

The value of this property is [`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/true) when the view is in memory or [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/false) when it is not. Accessing this property does not attempt to load the view if it is not currently in memory.
