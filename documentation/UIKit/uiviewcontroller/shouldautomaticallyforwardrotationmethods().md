# shouldAutomaticallyForwardRotationMethods()

**Framework**: UIKit  
**Kind**: method  
**Role**: Instance Method

Returns a Boolean value indicating whether rotation methods are forwarded to child view controllers.

**Availability**:
- iOS 6.0+ - Deprecated in 8.0
- iPadOS 6.0+ - Deprecated in 8.0
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+ - Deprecated in 13.1

> **Deprecated**: Manually forward calls to the [`viewWillTransition(to:with:)`](../uicontentcontainer/viewwilltransition%28to,with%29.md) method as needed.

## Declaration

```swift
func shouldAutomaticallyForwardRotationMethods() -> Bool
```

```objc
- (BOOL) shouldAutomaticallyForwardRotationMethods;
```

## Return Value

[`true`](../../Swift/true.md) if rotation methods are forwarded or [`false`](../../Swift/false.md) if they are not.

## Discussion

This method is called to determine whether to automatically forward rotation-related containment callbacks to child view controllers.

The default implementation returns [`true`](../../Swift/true.md). Subclasses of the [`UIViewController`](../uiviewcontroller.md) class that implement containment logic may override this method to control how these methods are forwarded. If you override this method and return [`false`](../../Swift/false.md), you are responsible for forwarding the following methods to child view controllers at the appropriate times:

- [`willRotate(to:duration:)`](./willrotate%28to,duration%29.md)
- [`willAnimateRotation(to:duration:)`](./willanimaterotation%28to,duration%29.md)
- [`didRotate(from:)`](./didrotate%28from%29.md)
