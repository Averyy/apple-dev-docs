#### Discussion

The presenting view controller is responsible for dismissing the view controller it presented. If you call this method on the presented view controller itself, UIKit asks the presenting view controller to handle the dismissal.

If you present several view controllers in succession, thus building a stack of presented view controllers, calling this method on a view controller lower in the stack dismisses its immediate child view controller and all view controllers above that child on the stack. When this happens, only the top-most view is dismissed in an animated fashion; any intermediate view controllers are simply removed from the stack. The top-most view is dismissed using its modal transition style, which may differ from the styles used by other view controllers lower in the stack.

If you want to retain a reference to the view controller’s presented view controller, get the value in the [`presentedViewController`](uiviewcontroller/presentedviewcontroller.md) property before calling this method.

The completion handler is called after the [`viewDidDisappear(_:)`](uiviewcontroller/viewdiddisappear(_:).md) method is called on the presented view controller.

## Parameters

- `flag`: Pass   to animate the transition.
- `completion`: The block to execute after the view controller is dismissed. This block has no return value and takes no parameters. You may specify   for this parameter.
