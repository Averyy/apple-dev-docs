**Kind**: property

The preferred size for the view controller’s view.

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
var preferredContentSize: CGSize { get set }
```

#### Discussion

The value in this property is used primarily when displaying the view controller’s content in a popover but may also be used in other situations. Changing the value of this property while the view controller is being displayed in a popover animates the size change; however, the change is not animated if you specify a width or height of `0.0`.
