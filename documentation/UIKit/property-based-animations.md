# Property-based animations

**Framework**: UIKit

Create animations by changing the properties of a view.

## Topics

### Essentials
- [class UIViewPropertyAnimator](uiviewpropertyanimator.md)
  A class that animates changes to views and allows the dynamic modification of those animations.
- [protocol UIViewAnimating](uiviewanimating.md)
  An interface for implementing custom animator objects.
### Timing curves
- [protocol UITimingCurveProvider](uitimingcurveprovider.md)
  An interface for providing the timing information needed to perform animations.
- [class UISpringTimingParameters](uispringtimingparameters.md)
  The timing information for animations that mimics the behavior of a spring.
- [class UICubicTimingParameters](uicubictimingparameters.md)
  The timing information for animations in the form of a cubic Bézier curve.
### In-progress animations
- [protocol UIViewImplicitlyAnimating](uiviewimplicitlyanimating.md)
  An interface for modifying an animation while it’s running.
