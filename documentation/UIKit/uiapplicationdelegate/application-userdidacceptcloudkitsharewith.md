# application(_:userDidAcceptCloudKitShareWith:)

**Framework**: UIKit  
**Kind**: method

Tells the delegate that the app now has access to shared information in CloudKit.

**Availability**:
- iOS 10.0+
- iPadOS 10.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- tvOS 10.0+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
optional func application(_ application: UIApplication, userDidAcceptCloudKitShareWith cloudKitShareMetadata: CKShareMetadata)
```

#### Discussion

If your app doesn’t support scenes, use this method to respond to a CloudKit Sharing invitation. In your implementation, accept the share by scheduling a [`CKAcceptSharesOperation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/ckacceptsharesoperation) object that contains the metadata object in the `cloudKitShareMetadata` parameter. After the share has been accepted, you can begin fetching records and incorporating the resulting data into your app. For a scene-based app, accept the invitation in your window scene delegate’s [`windowScene(_:userDidAcceptCloudKitShareWith:)`](uiwindowscenedelegate/windowscene(_:userdidacceptcloudkitsharewith:).md) method.

The system launches the app, as needed, before calling this method.

## Parameters

- `application`: The shared app object.
- `cloudKitShareMetadata`: Information about the CloudKit data that is now available to the app. Use this object to retrieve information about the [`CKShare`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit/ckshare) object and the associated records that are now available.
