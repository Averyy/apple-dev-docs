# application(_:handleOpen:)

**Framework**: UIKit  
**Kind**: method

Asks the delegate to open a resource identified by URL.

**Availability**:
- iOS 2.0+
- iPadOS 2.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
optional func application(_ application: UIApplication, handleOpen url: URL) -> Bool
```

#### Return Value

[`true`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/true) if the delegate successfully handled the request; [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/false) if the attempt to handle the URL failed.

#### Discussion

If the delegate also implements the [`application(_:open:sourceApplication:annotation:)`](uiapplicationdelegate/application(_:open:sourceapplication:annotation:).md) method, that method is called instead of this one.

This method is not called if the delegate returns [`false`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Swift/false) from both the [`application(_:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`](uiapplicationdelegate/application(_:willfinishlaunchingwithoptions:).md) and [`application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`](uiapplicationdelegate/application(_:didfinishlaunchingwithoptions:).md) methods. (If only one of the two methods is implemented, its return value determines whether this method is called.) If your app implements the [`applicationDidFinishLaunching(_:)`](uiapplicationdelegate/applicationdidfinishlaunching(_:).md) method instead of [`application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`](uiapplicationdelegate/application(_:didfinishlaunchingwithoptions:).md), this method is called to open the specified URL after the app has been initialized.

If a URL arrives while your app is suspended or running in the background, the system moves your app to the foreground prior to calling this method.

There is no equivalent notification for this delegation method.

## Parameters

- `application`: Your singleton app object.
- `url`: An object representing a URL (Universal Resource Locator). See the appendix of   for Apple-registered schemes for URLs.
