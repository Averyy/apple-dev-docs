# application(_:handleActionWithIdentifier:for:completionHandler:)

**Framework**: UIKit  
**Kind**: method

Called when your app has been activated because user selected a custom action from the alert panel of a local notification.

**Availability**:
- iOS 8.0+
- iPadOS 8.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
optional func application(_ application: UIApplication, handleActionWithIdentifier identifier: String?, for notification: UILocalNotification) async
```

#### Discussion

The app calls this method when the user taps an action button in an alert displayed in response to a local notification. Local notifications that include a registered category name in their [`category`](uilocalnotification/category.md) property display buttons for the actions in that category. If the user taps one of those buttons, the system wakes up the app (launching it if needed) and calls this method in the background. Your implementation of this method should perform the action associated with the specified `identifier` and execute the block in the `completionHandler` parameter as soon as you are done. Failure to execute the completion handler block at the end of your implementation will cause your app to be terminated.

To configure the actions for a given category, create a UIUserNotificationActionSettings object and register it with the app when you call the [`registerUserNotificationSettings(_:)`](uiapplication/registerusernotificationsettings(_:).md) method.

## Parameters

- `application`: The app object that received the local notification.
- `identifier`: The identifier associated with the custom action. This string corresponds to the identifier from the UILocalNotificationAction object that was used to configure the action in the local notification.
- `notification`: The local notification object that was triggered.
- `completionHandler`: A block to call when you are finished performing the action.
