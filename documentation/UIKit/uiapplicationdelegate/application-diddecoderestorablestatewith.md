**Framework**: UIKit  
**Kind**: method

Tells your delegate to restore any high-level state information as part of the state restoration process.

**Availability**:

- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
optional func application(_ application: UIApplication, didDecodeRestorableStateWith coder: NSCoder)
```

#### Discussion

The state restoration system calls this method as the final step in the state restoration process. By the time this method is called, all other restorable objects will have been restored and put back into their previous state. You can use this method to read any high-level app data you saved in the [`application(_:willEncodeRestorableStateWith:)`](uiapplicationdelegate/application(_:willencoderestorablestatewith:).md) method and apply it to your app.

## Parameters

- `application`: Your singleton app object.
- `coder`: The keyed archiver containing the app’s previously saved state information.
