# precisePreviousLocation(in:)

**Framework**: UIKit  
**Kind**: method

Returns a precise previous location for the touch, when available.

**Availability**:
- iOS 9.1+
- iPadOS 9.1+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- tvOS 9.0+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
func precisePreviousLocation(in view: UIView?) -> CGPoint
```

#### Return Value

A precise previous location for the touch.

#### Discussion

Use this method to get additional precision for a touch’s previous location (when available). Do not use the returned point for hit testing. In some cases, hit testing can indicate that the touch is within a view, but hit testing against the more precise location may indicate that the touch is outside of the view.

## Parameters

- `view`: The view that contained the touch.
