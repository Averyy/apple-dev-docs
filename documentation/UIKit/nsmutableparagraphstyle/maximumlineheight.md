## Declaration

```swift
var maximumLineHeight: CGFloat { get set }
```

```objc
@property (nonatomic) CGFloat maximumLineHeight;
```

## Discussion

This property contains the maximum height in points that any line in the receiver will occupy, regardless of the font size or size of any attached graphic. This value is always nonnegative. The default value is 0.

Glyphs and graphics exceeding this height will overlap neighboring lines; however, a maximum height of 0 implies no line height limit. Although this limit applies to the line itself, line spacing adds extra space between adjacent lines.
