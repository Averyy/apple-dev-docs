# actions(forTarget:forControlEvent:)

**Framework**: UIKit  
**Kind**: method

Returns the actions performed on a target object when the specified event occurs.

**Availability**:
- iOS 2.0+
- iPadOS 2.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- tvOS ?+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
func actions(forTarget target: Any?, forControlEvent controlEvent: UIControl.Event) -> [String]?
```

#### Return Value

An array [`NSString`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSString) objects containing the selector names of the corresponding action methods, or `nil` if there are no action methods associated with the specified target object and control event.

#### Discussion

Use this method to determine what action methods are called on the specified object in response to a particular control event. You can use the [`NSSelectorFromString(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/NSSelectorFromString(_:)) function to convert the returned strings to valid selectors, as needed.

## Parameters

- `target`: The target object—that is, an object that has an action method associated with this control. You must pass an explicit object for this method to return a meaningful result. Specifying   always returns  .
- `controlEvent`: A single control event constant representing the event for which you want the list of action methods. For a list of possible constants, see
