# insertSubview(_:at:)

**Framework**: UIKit  
**Kind**: method  
**Role**: Instance Method

Inserts a subview at the specified index.

**Availability**:
- iOS
- iPadOS
- Mac Catalyst
- tvOS
- visionOS

## Declaration

```swift
func insertSubview(_ view: UIView, at index: Int)
```

```objc
- (void) insertSubview:(UIView *) view atIndex:(NSInteger) index;
```

## Discussion

This method establishes a strong reference to `view` and sets its next responder to the receiver, which is its new superview.

Views can have only one superview. If `view` already has a superview and that view is not the receiver, this method removes the previous superview before making the receiver its new superview.

## Parameters

- `view`: The view to insert. This value cannot be `nil`.
- `index`: The index in the array of the [`subviews`](./subviews.md) property at which to insert the view. Subview indices start at `0` and cannot be greater than the number of subviews.
