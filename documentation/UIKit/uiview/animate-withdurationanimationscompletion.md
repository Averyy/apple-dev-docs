# animate(withDuration:animations:completion:)

**Framework**: UIKit  
**Kind**: method

Animate changes to one or more views using the specified duration and completion handler.

**Availability**:
- iOS 4.0+
- iPadOS 4.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- tvOS ?+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
class func animate(withDuration duration: TimeInterval, animations: @escaping () -> Void, completion: ((Bool) -> Void)? = nil)
```

#### Discussion

This method performs the specified animations immediately using the [`curveEaseInOut`](uiview/animationoptions/curveeaseinout.md) and [`UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionNone`](uiviewanimationoptions/uiviewanimationoptiontransitionnone.md) animation options.

For example, if you want to fade a view until it is totally transparent and then remove it from your view hierarchy, you could use code similar to the following:

```objc
[UIView animateWithDuration:0.2
     animations:^{view.alpha = 0.0;}
     completion:^(BOOL finished){ [view removeFromSuperview]; }];
```

During an animation, user interactions are temporarily disabled for the views being animated. (Prior to iOS 5, user interactions are disabled for the entire application.)

## Parameters

- `duration`: The total duration of the animations, measured in seconds. If you specify a negative value or  , the changes are made without animating them.
- `animations`: A block object containing the changes to commit to the views. This is where you programmatically change any animatable properties of the views in your view hierarchy. This block takes no parameters and has no return value. This parameter must not be  .
- `completion`: A block object to be executed when the animation sequence ends. This block has no return value and takes a single Boolean argument that indicates whether or not the animations actually finished before the completion handler was called. If the duration of the animation is 0, this block is performed at the beginning of the next run loop cycle. This parameter may be  .
