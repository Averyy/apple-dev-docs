**Framework**: UIKit  
**Kind**: method  
**Role**: Instance Method

Inserts a view above another view in the view hierarchy.

**Availability**:

## Declaration

```swift
func insertSubview(_ view: UIView, aboveSubview siblingSubview: UIView)
```

```objc
- (void) insertSubview:(UIView *) view aboveSubview:(UIView *) siblingSubview;
```

#### Discussion

This method establishes a strong reference to `view` and sets its next responder to the receiver, which is its new superview.

Views can have only one superview. If `view` already has a superview and that view is not the receiver, this method removes the previous superview before making the receiver its new superview.

## Parameters

- `view`: The view to insert. It’s removed from its superview if it’s not a sibling of `siblingSubview`.
- `siblingSubview`: The sibling view that will be behind the inserted view.
