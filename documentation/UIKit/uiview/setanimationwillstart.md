# setAnimationWillStart(_:)

**Framework**: UIKit  
**Kind**: method

Sets the message to send to the animation delegate when the animation starts.

**Availability**:
- iOS 2.0+
- iPadOS 2.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- tvOS ?+

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
class func setAnimationWillStart(_ selector: Selector?)
```

#### Discussion

If you specify an animation delegate for a begin/commit set of animations, you use this method to specify the selector to call before the animations begin. This method does nothing if called from outside of an animation block. It must be called between calls to the [`beginAnimations(_:context:)`](uiview/beginanimations(_:context:).md) and [`commitAnimations()`](uiview/commitanimations().md) methods. This selector is set to `NULL` by default.

> **Note**:  Your start selector is not called if animations are disabled.

 Your start selector is not called if animations are disabled.

Use of this method is discouraged in iOS 4.0 and later. If you are using the block-based animation methods, you can include your delegate’s start code directly inside your block.

## Parameters

- `selector`: An optional application-supplied context. This is the context data passed to the   method. This argument can be  .
