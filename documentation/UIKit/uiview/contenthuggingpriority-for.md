# contentHuggingPriority(for:)

**Framework**: UIKit  
**Kind**: method

Returns the priority with which a view resists being made larger than its intrinsic size.

**Availability**:
- iOS 6.0+
- iPadOS 6.0+
- Mac Catalyst 13.1+
- tvOS ?+
- visionOS 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
@MainActor
func contentHuggingPriority(for axis: NSLayoutConstraint.Axis) -> UILayoutPriority
```

#### Return Value

The priority with which the view should resist being enlarged from its intrinsic size on the specified axis.

#### Discussion

The constraint-based layout system uses these priorities when determining the best layout for views that are encountering constraints that would require them to be larger than their intrinsic size.

## Parameters

- `axis`: The axis of the view that might be enlarged.
