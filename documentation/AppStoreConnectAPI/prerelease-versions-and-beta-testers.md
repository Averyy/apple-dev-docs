# Prerelease Versions and Beta Testers

**Framework**: App Store Connect API

Manage your beta testing program, including beta testers and groups, apps, App Clips, and builds.

#### Overview

TestFlight allows you to distribute your apps to beta testers before releasing your apps on the App Store. You can learn more about TestFlight on the [`Apple Developer website`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/testflight/).

Using the App Store Connect API, you can automate the same tasks you perform in the TestFlight section of App Store Connect; for example:

- Inviting testers to your app
- Managing your builds, groups, and public links
- Creating App Clip experiences for testers
- Submitting your build for external beta testing
