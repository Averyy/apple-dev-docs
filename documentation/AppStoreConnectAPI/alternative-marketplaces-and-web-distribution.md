# Alternative Marketplaces and Web Distribution

**Framework**: App Store Connect API

Manage keys, packages, and search for alternative app distribution.

#### Overview

Use the APIs in this collection to help facilitate the distribution of your apps to users in the EU on an alternative app marketplace or from your website. To learn more, see [`Update on apps distributed in the European Union`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/).

You can set up and configure your apps for alternative distribution and configure interactions with Apple Services. Use this API to manage:

- Alternative distribution domains
- Marketplace search configurations
- Downloads and management of alternative distribution packages
