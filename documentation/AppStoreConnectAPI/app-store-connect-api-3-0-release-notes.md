##### New Features

- Set up and manage all your Game Center features, like Achievements and Leaderboards. To review the full set of Game Center features, see [`Game Center`](game-center.md).
- Configure specific regions where you’d like to offer your app for pre-order and set different release dates for each region. For more information on settings for pre-order, see [`App availability`](app-availability.md).
- Use new endpoints for managing Export Compliance with [`Read an App’s Encryption Declarations`](get-v1-apps-_id_-appencryptiondeclarations.md) and now [`Modify a Build`](patch-v1-builds-_id_.md) allows you to include `appEncryptionDeclarations` in the payload.

##### Deprecations
