# App Store Connect API 1.7 release notes

**Framework**: App Store Connect API

Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.

#### Overview

App Store Connect API version 1.7 provides resources that enable you to automate actions you take in App Store Connect.

##### New Features

- The new resources in [`App Events and Metadata`](app-events-and-metadata.md) support scheduling and managing in-app events, including [`App Events`](app-events.md), [`App Event Video Clips`](app-event-video-clips.md), [`App Event Screenshots`](app-event-screenshots.md), and [`App Event Localizations`](app-event-localizations.md).
- New resources support creating and managing your app’s custom product pages, including [`App Custom Product Pages`](app-custom-product-pages.md), [`App Custom Product Page Versions`](app-custom-product-page-versions.md), and [`App Custom Product Page Localizations`](app-custom-product-page-localizations.md).
- The [`App Store version experiments`](app-store-version-experiments.md) resource now supports creating and managing product page optimization treatments.
- The [`Review submissions`](review-submissions.md) and [`Review submission items`](review-submission-items.md) resources support the updated App Store submission process, which lets you submit multiple items, submit without a new app version, and retrieve the submission statuses.

##### Deprecations

- The [`App Store version submissions`](app-store-version-submissions.md) resource and all its related endpoints and objects are now deprecated, including: `POST-v1-appStoreVersionSubmissions`, [`Delete an App Store Version Submission`](delete-v1-appstoreversionsubmissions-_id_.md), [`AppStoreVersionSubmission`](appstoreversionsubmission.md), `AppStoreVersionSubmissionCreateRequest`, and [`AppStoreVersionSubmissionResponse`](appstoreversionsubmissionresponse.md).
