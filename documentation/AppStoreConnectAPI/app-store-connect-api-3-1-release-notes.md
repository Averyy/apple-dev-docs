# App Store Connect API 3.1 release notes

**Framework**: App Store Connect API

Update your server-side code to use new features, and test your code against API changes.

#### Overview

App Store Connect API version 3.1 provides resources that enable you to automate actions you take in App Store Connect.

##### New Features

- Tester Metrics and Metadata now help developers identify relevant, engaged, and active testers within the tester panel to improve beta-app quality. Developers can now read session count, crash count, and feedback count for each tester. For more information see [`Read beta tester metrics for an app`](get-v1-apps-_id_-metrics-betatesterusages.md).
- Game Center matchmaking rules help create better matches between players in multiplayer games using game-specific rules. You can configure your rules and test them with sample match requests and player properties. For more information, see [`Rules`](rules.md) and [`Testing`](testing.md).
- Game Center matchmaking metrics diagnose performance and other issues with matchmaking. You can get match requests, queue information, results, errors, and more. For more information, see [`Metrics`](metrics.md).
