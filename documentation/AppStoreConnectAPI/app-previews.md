# App Previews

**Framework**: App Store Connect API

Upload and download app previews for an app locale and display target.

#### Overview

An `appPreviews` resource represents a single app preview for an app locale and display target. Use this resource to:

- Upload new app previews to App Store Connect.
- Download existing app previews.
- Set a custom timestamp for the preview’s poster frame.

To upload app previews, begin by creating an [`App Preview Sets`](app-preview-sets.md) resource for the locale and display target. For more information, see [`App preview specifications`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-preview-specifications).
