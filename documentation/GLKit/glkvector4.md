##### Fields

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `x` | The first component in the vector. Typically used when the vector refers to a position or normal. |
| `y` | The second component in the vector. Typically used when the vector refers to a position or normal. |
| `z` | The third component in the vector. Typically used when the vector refers to a position or normal. |
| `w` | The fourth component in the vector. Typically used when the vector refers to a position. |
| `r` | The first component in the vector. Typically used when the vector refers to a color value. |
| `g` | The second component in the vector. Typically used when the vector refers to a color value. |
| `b` | The third component in the vector. Typically used when the vector refers to a color value. |
| `a` | The fourth component in the vector. Typically used when the vector refers to a color value. |
| `s` | The first component in the vector. Typically used when the vector refers to texture coordinates. |
| `t` | The second component in the vector. Typically used when the vector refers to texture coordinates. |
| `p` | The third component in the vector. Typically used when the vector refers to texture coordinates. |
| `q` | The third component in the vector. Typically used when the vector refers to texture coordinates. |
| `v` | The elements of the vector expressed as an array. |
