# acceleration

**Framework**: Webkitjs  
**Kind**: instp

The acceleration that the user is giving to the device. 

**Availability**:
- Safari Mobile 4.2+

## Declaration

```swift
readonly attribute Acceleration acceleration;
```

#### Discussion

The acceleration data are expressed in m/s^2 and use the following `x`, `y`, and `z` axis properties represented as doubles:

This property is `null` if the device cannot provide the user acceleration—that is, if the device does not have a gyroscope. 

Use the [`accelerationIncludingGravity`](devicemotionevent/1629110-accelerationincludinggravity.md) property to get the total acceleration.

> **Note**: If the device does not have a gyroscope, then you may need to implement your own gravity direction detection using a low pass filter.
