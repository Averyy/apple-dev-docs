# clip

**Framework**: Webkitjs  
**Kind**: instm

Constrains the clipping region of the canvas to the current path.

**Availability**:
- Safari Desktop 3.0+
- Safari Mobile 1.0+

## Declaration

```swift
void clip(
    DOMPath path, 
    optional CanvasWindingRule winding
);
```

#### Discussion

Use this method to treat the current path as a mask for drawing operations. For example, if you call `drawImage()` subsequent to calling `clip()`, the image is clipped at the borders of the current path.
