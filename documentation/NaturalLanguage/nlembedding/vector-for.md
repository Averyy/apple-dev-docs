#### Discussion

> ❗ **Important**: This method isn’t safe to call concurrently on a shared [`NLEmbedding`](nlembedding.md) instance. Calling it from multiple threads, queues, or tasks at the same time can corrupt the embedding’s state and crash your app. Serialize calls into a shared instance, or give each thread its own instance.

## Parameters
