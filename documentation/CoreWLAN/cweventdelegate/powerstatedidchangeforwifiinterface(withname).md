**Kind**: method  
**Role**: Instance Method

## Declaration

```swift
optional func powerStateDidChangeForWiFiInterface(withName interfaceName: String)
```

```objc
- (void) powerStateDidChangeForWiFiInterfaceWithName:(NSString *) interfaceName;
```

## Discussion

Register for power state change notifications by sending the [`startMonitoringEvent(with:)`](../cwwificlient/startmonitoringevent%28with%29.md) message to a Wi-Fi client object with the [`CWEventType.powerDidChange`](../cweventtype/powerdidchange.md) event type.

Use the Wi-Fi interface’s [`powerOn()`](../cwinterface/poweron%28%29.md) method to query the current Wi-Fi power state.

## Parameters

- `interfaceName`: The name of the Wi-Fi interface on which the power changed.
