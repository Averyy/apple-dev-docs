# Parameter Vocabularies

**Framework**: SiriKit

The keys you include in your global vocabulary file to describe app-specific terms.

#### Overview

The `ParameterVocabularies` key contains the custom terminology that is global to all users of your app. This key contains an array of dictionaries, each of which defines a set of terms and the intent properties to which those terms apply. The keys for the dictionary are as follows:

Xcode helps you add terms to your vocabulary file. When you create a property list file with the name `AppIntentVocabulary.plist`, Xcode knows that the file should contain custom vocabulary, and it makes only the relevant keys available in the property list editor. The figure below shows an example of a global vocabulary file in Xcode that contains custom terms for a workout app.
