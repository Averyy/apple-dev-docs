# UserReportInitiatorIdentifier

**Framework**: SCSIControllerDriverKit  
**Kind**: method

Gets the SCSI device identifier for the host bus adapter (HBA) in response to a call from the framework.

**Availability**:
- DriverKit ?+

## Declaration

```swift
kern_return_t UserReportInitiatorIdentifier(uint64_t * id);
```

#### Return Value

A value that indicates the result of getting the initiator identifier. [`kIOReturnSuccess`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/DriverKit/kIOReturnSuccess) indicates success. For error definitions, see [`IOKit Constants`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/iokit/iokit_constants).

#### Discussion

The framework calls this method to determine the SCSI device identifier that the initiator has assigned for this HBA.

## Parameters

- `id`: On return, set this to the value of the initiator identifier.
