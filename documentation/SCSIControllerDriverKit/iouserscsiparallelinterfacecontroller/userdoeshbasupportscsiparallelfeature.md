# UserDoesHBASupportSCSIParallelFeature

**Framework**: SCSIControllerDriverKit  
**Kind**: method

Determines whether the driver extension class supports a specific feature in response to a call from the framework.

**Availability**:
- DriverKit ?+

## Declaration

```swift
kern_return_t UserDoesHBASupportSCSIParallelFeature(uint32_t theValue, bool * result);
```

#### Return Value

A value that indicates the result of determining if the driver extension class supports the feature. [`kIOReturnSuccess`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/DriverKit/kIOReturnSuccess) indicates success. For error definitions, see [`IOKit Constants`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/iokit/iokit_constants).

#### Discussion

The SCSI parallel interconnect standard defines the features that `theValue` specifies.

## Parameters

- `theValue`: The SCSI parallel interconnect (SPI) feature to check.
- `result`: A pointer to a Boolean value. On return, set this value to   if it supports the feature, and   if it doesn’t.
