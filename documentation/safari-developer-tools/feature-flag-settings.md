# Changing Feature Flag settings in Safari on macOS

**Framework**: Safari Developer Features

Test new web platform features before they ship in Safari.

#### Overview

The web is constantly evolving with new features and technologies. It can be exciting to see potential future tools and technologies, and even more exciting to begin experimenting with them before they ship in web browsers.

Safari lets you enable these features using the new  settings, which can be opened from the [`Develop menu`](develop-menu.md) by choosing .

Features are organized by topic, like Animation, CSS, JavaScript, Media, and more, making it easy to find related features. They can also be searched by both feature name and status.

When you toggle a feature to a non-default state, its name is displayed in bold.

> ❗ **Important**: The default setting for each feature flag is how users will generally experience your content, so make sure your pages gracefully handle the absence of a feature you’ve enabled for development.

#### Feature Statuses

There are four possible statuses for a feature, each with a different meaning and default state. Non-developer features will typically start as  features, and then move to  as the feature and spec the feature is based on matures, eventually becoming  features.
