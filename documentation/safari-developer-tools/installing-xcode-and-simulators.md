# Installing Xcode and Simulators

**Framework**: Safari Developer Features

Install simulators to use for web development.

#### Overview

iOS, iPadOS, and (on a Mac with Apple silicon) visionOS simulators are available in macOS as part of Xcode, which is free in the Mac App Store.

To get started using Simulators:

1. Install [`Xcode`](https://developer.apple.comhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) from the Mac App Store.
2. Once installed, launch Xcode so that it can complete its first launch.
3. A dialog will be presented that indicates which Simulator runtimes are built-in, and which Simulator runtimes you may download. For now, choose  to finish setting up Xcode.
4. Once Xcode has finished setting up, relaunch Safari to begin using the  part of the [`Develop menu`](develop-menu.md) and  in [`Responsive Design Mode`](responsive-design-mode.md).
