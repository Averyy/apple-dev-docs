Features like [`Web Inspector`](web-inspector.md) in Safari on macOS let you inspect and experiment with the layout of your webpage, including trying changes to styles, visualizing `grid` and `flex` contain layouts, adjusting typography, including custom variation axes, and emulating user preferences like color scheme or reduced motion to help ensure your content looks great for every user. You can also use Web Inspector to set breakpoints in JavaScript, interactively debug, and inspect the state of your page as you debug. Tools like Timelines let you visualize the impact of your scripts and layout on things like performance and memory use, as well as help identify causes of long frame times.

You can also use [`WebDriver`](webdriver.md) to automate testing your webpages in Safari. As the web evolves, it is important to continually test your webpages to ensure they behave as you expect. WebDriver is a cross-browser API for automating testing of web content supported by all major browsers across platforms, without requiring browser-specific code.
